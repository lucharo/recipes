ingredients: (2 servings) 
1 cup organic sprouted pumpkin seeds (I use @go_raw ) 
1 cup water
1 tbsp almond milk
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp turmeric
pinch of pepper 
1/2 tsp baking powder 
diced veggies of choice 

Instructions:
	1.	Blend all ingredients in a blender until smooth except baking powder.
	2.	Add scramble into a bowl then stir in baking powder quickly. 
	3.	Use a nonstick pan for this scramble!!! Saut√© veggies first. Then add the pumpkin seed egg to the pan on medium heat. let it sit and bubble up for a minute before moving it around in the pan. Saute until a scramble texture (will take 10 min). 
	4.	Serve and enjoy!
