Shoutout to Ronke for @9jafoodie for this idea. I am usually the only person eating this so I make it in my mini food processor. The link to my kitchen aid food processor is in my bio!   
  
I usually boil about 2 cups worth of west African yam till tender (about 10-15mins depending on how small you cut the yam) Please do not boil with salt, the texture changes completely. While the yam is warm, place in your food processor and process till it come together as a SOFT ball. It will be very sticky but you can certainly shape it. Enjoy with soup of choice :)
