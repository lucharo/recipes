One of my all time favourite tofu recipes, this method is foolproof, versatile and packed with flavour, give it a save!   
  
Chop 1 block of firm tofu into cubes, and coat in a drizzle of soy sauce & smoked paprika, then evenly cover in cornflour. Lightly fry in sesame oil until golden.   
  
For the sauce, fry;  
2 cloves garlic (crushed)   
1 tbsp ginger (crushed)  
2 tbsp gochujang  
1 tbsp maple syrup  
4 tbsp soy sauce  
2 tsp rice vinegar   
2 tsp brown sugar  
2 tbsp ketchup   
  
Serve with noodles/rice or veggies and top with sesame seeds and spring onion & enjoy! ðŸ”¥
