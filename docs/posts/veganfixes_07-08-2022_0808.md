A protein-packed vegan snack! You can enjoy them on their own,   
or add them to your favourite dishes for a crispy texture.  
  
Ingredients  
400g of canned chickpeas  
1 tsp black pepper  
1 tsp Paprika powder  
1 tsp salt  
2 tbsp olive oil  
1 tbsp corn starch   
  
-Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).  
-Blot chickpeas with a paper towel to dry them.  
-In a bowl, toss chickpeas with olive oil, corn starch and season to taste with salt, paprika powder, and black pepper.  
-Spread on a baking sheet, and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until browned and crunchy. Watch carefully the last few minutes to avoid burning. (They can be kept in a sealed jar for around 3/4 days in the refrigerator)
