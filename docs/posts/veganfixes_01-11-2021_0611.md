 \
Serves 4\
 \
🌿 1 x 400g / 14.1oz tin of chickpeas, drained + rinsed\
🌿 salt + pepper\
🌿 olive oil\
🌿 2 tsp soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free)\
🌿 2 tsp maple syrup\
🌿 1 tsp smoked paprika\
🌿 1 large carrot, peeled into strips\
🌿 1 Romaine lettuce, chopped\
🌿 2 large handfuls of kale, chopped\
 \
For the sauce:\
🌿 70g / 2.5oz cashews\
🌿 1/2 lemon, juice only\
🌿 1 garlic clove, peeled\
🌿 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard\
🌿 2 tbsp nutritional yeast\
🌿 2 tsp capers\
🌿 120ml / 4 fl.oz unsweetened plant-based milk\
 \
1️⃣ Preheat the oven to 160°C fan / 350°F and line 2 large trays with baking paper. Meanwhile, add the cashews to a bowl and cover with hot water from a kettle. Leave to soak.\
 \
2️⃣ Add the chickpeas to one tray, season with pinches of salt and pepper, drizzle over 1 tsp of olive oil and mix. Then roast for 35-45 minutes or until crispy.\
 \
3️⃣ Meanwhile, combine the soy sauce, maple syrup, smoked paprika, pinches of salt and pepper, and 1 tsp of olive oil in a mixing bowl. Add the peeled carrot strips and stir. Leave to marinade for 20 minutes, then lay out the strips on the second tray and roast for 10-15 minutes or until crispy, turning halfway to prevent them burning. Tip: if the carrot isn’t getting crispy, turn the oven down and leave them in for longer.\
 \
4️⃣ Add the soaked cashews to a blender with the lemon juice, garlic clove, Dijon mustard, nutritional yeast, capers, plant-based milk and pinches of salt and pepper. Blend until smooth. Add the chopped lettuce and kale to a large bowl, then stir in the sauce.\
 \
5️⃣ When you’re ready to serve, divide the salad between bowls, then top with the chickpea croutons and carrot ‘bacon’. Delicious!
