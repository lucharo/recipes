Actually I’m not a big fan of eggplants but this recipe totally changed my mind!   
I took @gordongram viral recipe but simplified it A LOT and boom MUST TRY! 😏   
  
💡HACKS  
When broiling the eggplant, it’s skin should start to „separate“ from the inside.   
  
RECIPE (2 eggplants each 314cal/6P/75C/8F):  
-2 eggplant  
-1 Tbsp oil  
-1/3 cup (90g) bbq sauce  
-1/3 cup (80ml) red wine  
-salt to taste  
Rub:  
-1 Tbsp ground cumin  
-3 Tbsp garlic powder  
-2 Tbsp smoked paprika  
-1 Tbsp dried thyme  
To serve: (optional)  
-Chili flakes  
-vegan yogurt dip (see focaccia video)  
BROIL the eggplant at 250Celsius/480Fahrenheit for around 10mins but turn every now and then/REMOVE the skin, make the rub and sprinkle over 2 Tbsp of it  and some salt/ADD the oil and massage the eggplant/ADD the red wine and bake at 200Celsius/400Fahrenheit for 40min but turn after 20min/BRUSH both sides with BBQ sauce and for additional 15-20min
