# PEKING TOFFEE APPLES 🍎 These Chinese-style Toffee Apple Fritters are served in caramel SO HOT that you need to plunge them into ICY WATER to set the toffee before eating! 🥶 There’s nothing quite like it. Uniquely crispy, crunchy and sweet. ⚠️ Take care when making this recipe as working with hot sugar is extremely dangerous!! ⚠️
