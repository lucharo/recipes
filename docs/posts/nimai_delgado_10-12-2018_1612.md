I’d smash this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!

Creamy baked sweet potato, roasted mushrooms and Brussels sprouts, avocado and peas 😍👏🏻 My absolute favorite foods on one plate 😋. I topped my bowl with hemp seeds, black cumins seeds and of course tahini 💚😁🙏.
.
To get a perfect creamy sweet potato preheat the oven to 240 degrees Celsius (450 degrees Fahrenheit).
Moisten the sweet potato with water, make several cuts all over with a knife and wrap it in aluminum foil. 
Place on the rack in the middle of the oven and bake for about 1 hour. The sweetpotatoe is ready when it feels soft and can be pressed in. 😍🙏😋.
.
I wish you all a great evening 😍💚
