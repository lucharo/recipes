‚Å£  
My dad used to always come home with the huge thing of carrot cake from Costco around this time of year, so I‚Äôve been craving it a lottttt and finally landed on this recipe ‚Å£that I thought was (*better*) just as good. ‚Å£  
‚Å£  
This carrot loaf cake has a tight, tender moist crumb, yet still fluffy‚Äî generously spiced and studded with rum raisins & pecans.‚Å£  
‚Å£  
As much as living on my own is nice‚Ä¶ I MISS MY FAMILY LOL üò≠ and having people around me b/c it does get pretty lonely (esp working from home). I rarely ever get to see my dad and sisters, so I like to leave them some food as a small way to still connect with them. ‚Å£  
‚Å£  
How about you?? Do you miss living at home or love the independent adult life? üôÇ ‚Å£
