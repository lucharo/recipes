🌱 2-3 king oyster mushrooms \

5. Turn down the heat then add the garlic, fresh chili (optional), nori powder and fry for a further few minutes.\
6. Add the red pepper flakes marinade and cook for a further minute. Then add noodles and cook for a minute or 2 and it is ready to serve.\
7. Top with spring onion, fresh chillies(optional) and sesame seeds(optional).\

(No need to cut the shrooms into shrimp shapes, you can just cut them into circles like scallops, I am just extra! 😉)\
