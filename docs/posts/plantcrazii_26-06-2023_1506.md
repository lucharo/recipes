# I’m excited about sharing this High Protein Pistachio Ice Cream with you because it’s so darn good! To make this treat dairy-free I used @earthsown ‘s Almond Unsweetened Original, it has a rich and creamy taste that I really love. I left instructions for you to be able to make this recipe even if you don’t have an ice cream machine, enjoy!

Pistachio Ice Cream  
  
120g unshelled and unsalted pistachios   
280ml Earth’s Own Almond Unsweetened Original  
200ml full fat canned coconut milk  
3 tbsp sweetener of choice (coconut sugar, brown sugar, cane sugar, vegan white sugar)  
1/8 tsp salt  
1 tbsp melted coconut oil  
1 scoop vanilla protein powder  
  
1//4 cup of chopped pistachios for garnish.  
  
Add the pistachios to a blender, alternate the speed from low medium to high until the pistachios have broken down into small bits.  
  
A little at a time, pour in the Earth’s Own Almond Unsweetened Original while blending. Blend until the mixture becomes smooth and chunk free.  
  
Add in the remaining ingredients except for the chopped pistachios(garnish) and blend until combined.  
  
If you have an ice cream machine, add the mixture to the machine.  
  
If you don’t have an ice cream machine, transfer the mixture to a metal or glass container then cover it with parchment paper. Press the parchment paper down onto the cream to avoid air from getting in during the freeze process. Place it in the freezer.  
  
After 2 hours, remove it from the freezer and give the mixture a mix and add in the chopped pistachios. This mixing  process will help you avoid ice crystals in the final product.   
  
Cover and place the mixture back into the freezer for 24 hours.  
  
Remove it from the freezer the next day and allow it to taw until it becomes easy to scoop (approximately 15 minutes).
