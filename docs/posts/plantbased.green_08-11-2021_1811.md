Recipe:  
1 cup oats, 2/3 cup of plant milk, 1 tbs baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, pinch of salt, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 cup maple syrup, 3 tbs nut butter, 1 banana. Add it all to a blender, blend and bake at 350 for 25 minutes. Oh and I used a 6x9 inch pan but a bread pan or an 8x8 would work as well. Bake time may change a little depending on size of pan.
