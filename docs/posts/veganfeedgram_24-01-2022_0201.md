Recipe (makes 8-10 slices):

Ingredients:
3/4 cup soy milk
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 tbsp lemon zest
1/2 cup vegan yogurt
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 tbsp vanilla extract
2 cups plain all-purpose flour
1 cup caster sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp sea salt

Lemon Icing Ingredients:
2 cups icing sugar
3-4 tbsp lemon juice

Preheat the oven to 180C.  Line a loaf pan and set aside.

In a large bowl, add in the milk, lemon juice, lemon zest, yogurt, olive oil, and vanilla.  Mix well until combined.

Add in the remaining dry ingredients and mix until just smooth.

Pour into the prepared loaf pan and bake in the oven for 50 minutes or until the center is cooked (stick a skewer in the center, if it comes out clean and not wet, then it’s ready). Remove from oven and allow to cool at room temperature.

In the meantime, add the icing sugar and lemon juice into a bowl.  Whisk well until you reach a smooth consistency.  Add more or less lemon juice, depending on how thick or thin you want your icing to be.

Once loaf has cooled, pour your icing on top.  Finish off with extra lemon zest, slice then serve.  Any leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.

Want to make this loaf even more special?  Add in 2 tbsp poppy seeds or 1 cup of blueberries to the batter before baking.

Enjoy!
