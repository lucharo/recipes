# Ad. Iâ€™ve been using the @veri method to educate myself on why stabilizing my blood glucose levels can be a powerful tool to take control of my health. Glucose levels rise and fall throughout the day, and itâ€™s perfectly normal. Itâ€™s a sign that your metabolism is working!

Itâ€™s the rapid spikes and crashes throughout the day that can lead to poor metabolic health in the future, low energy, cravings and weight gain. Those are the ones we want to avoid, according to the Veri method ðŸ“ˆ  
  
I have learned so much about my own body, what it loves and what it doesnâ€™t love that much. Testing out new recipes that give me a better glucose response has been so much fun!
