‚ù§Ô∏èSave, share and tag friend!  
  
I‚Äôve never made a banana bread like this before. I used aquafaba which is the brine from canned chickpeas, and some lemon zest. These are both two ingredients that are typically thrown away and forgotten. Wait, what about the banana peels? If you feel adventurous the peel could be incorporated as well, but I‚Äôve left it out in favour of being composted.   
  
‚¨áÔ∏èYou need to try this‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs how to make this delicious banana bread!  
  
70g aquafaba   
240g gluten-free plain flour  
3 ripe bananas, mashed and 1 ripe banana for decoration   
20g sunflower oil  
60g vegan butter, melted  
120g light brown sugar  
Zest of lemon  
2 tsp almond extract (or vanilla extract)  
1/2 tsp salt  
1 tsp baking soda  
2 tsp mixed spice   
50g walnuts, optional  
  
To make the vegan buttermilk:  
90ml plant-based milk  
2 tbsp lemon juice  
  
Stir the ingredients together and sit for a few minutes.  
  
Pre heat oven to 175C (350F)  
  
Whisk the aquafaba for 3-5 minutes until it‚Äôs foamy and volume increases.   
  
In a mixing bowl, add the oil, butter and sugar whisk to combine. Next, add the sugar mixture to the whipped aquafaba, almond extract, vegan buttermilk and 3 mashed bananas. Then combine the flour, baking soda, salt, lemon zest and walnuts fold.  
  
Pour the mixture in a lined loaf tin and carefully lay the sliced banana on top with a sprinkle of brown sugar. Bake in the oven for roughly 45-50 minutes.   
  
Allow to cool before slicing the banana bread.   
  
Enjoy!
