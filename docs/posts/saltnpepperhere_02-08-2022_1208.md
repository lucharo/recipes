\
It’s a blender batter where everything is simply blended until smooth, making it so fast and fool-proof. inspired by Hawai’i-style butter mochi, these things are ~addictive~ \
\
SAVE this to make and tag me if you do 💛\
\
what you’ll need:\
⊹ fresh corn (2-3 cobs)\
⊹ coconut milk or coconut cream\
⊹ glutinous rice flour \
⊹ eggs\
⊹ sugar \
⊹ butter\
⊹ vanilla\
⊹ salt\
⊹ baking powder (~not~ baking soda sawyyy)\
\
notes:\
⇢ glutinous rice flour is also called “sweet rice flour” - you’re good with either of those. But don’t confuse it with “rice flour”, that’s different and not good for this\
⇢ use spatula to scrape bottom and sides of blender 1x before a final blend to ensure no clumps of glutinous rice flour\
⇢ I baked it in 8x8” square pan but I’ve also used 9” round pan or 11” cast iron skillet \
⇢ despite the name, glutinous rice flour is gluten free so this treat is amazing for those with a gluten intolerance!\
