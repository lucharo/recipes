⁣  
ENTER: Savory Instant Ramen Pancakes (Ramen Chijimi). Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy in the middle, loaded with various veggies and a party of flavours!! Kinda like a fusion of kimchi pancakes & Hiroshima style okonomiyaki. ( o˘◡˘o) ⁣  
⁣⁣⁣  
My grandpa used to make us noodle chijimi (Korean style pancakes) with leftover somen or ramen, tried it with a packet of shin ramyun and it is SO 👏🏻 DANG 👏🏻 yummy 🙂. Not too spicy but the flavours come through! A little ~tangy~, cheesy and sweet. ⁣
