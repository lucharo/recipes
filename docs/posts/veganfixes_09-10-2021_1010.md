Spanish tortilla is a spanish omelette made with eggs, potatoes and onion. My mom made it oftentimes when I was a little Maya and FINALLY I made a good vegan version. 🥳\
The silken tofu gives it a very „eggy“ texture, my whole family (even my grandma) loved it…☺️🙏\
\
👩‍🍳 To flip it: place a plate on top of the pan, turn it upside down that the tortilla falls on the plate, let it slide back in the pan.\
Much love\
