# SAMBAL GORENG TEMPE(H) by @itslizmiu ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© If you donâ€™t like tempe, try it a more traditional way! Growing up I always knew tempe to be fried til crispy and often coated in a sticky or spicy sauce, which is the way the Indonesians do it (my Nini is from Java)! Itâ€™s often served alongside meat dishes - and all Indonesians know and love it, not just the vegetarian or vegan ones! So I say - more tempe for everyone! If youâ€™ve tried it and didnâ€™t like it - give it another chance with this easy and delicious Sambal Goreng Tempe!Â
