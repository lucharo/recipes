Recipe:\
\
âœ…Ingredients:\
1 (14 or 16-ounce) block extra firm or super firm tofu, pressed, cut into about 1-inch pieces \
Â½ tablespoon tamari or soy sauce (preferably low sodium)\
1 teaspoon paprika\
1 teaspoon garlic powder\
Â½ teaspoon onion powder\
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (optional)\
Â½ teaspoon salt\
Â¼ teaspoon white or black pepper\
2 teaspoons cornstarch\
Â½ teaspoon neutral flavored oil (optional)\
âœ…Freeze your tofu for at least 12 hours or up to 4 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or microwave. Drain and press briefly to remove excess liquid. (Or use super firm tofu that has already been pre-pressed!)\
âœ…Place in a bowl or reusable bag and toss with the tamari. Add the remaining ingredients and toss to coat. \
âœ…Air fry at 400Â°F for about 15 minutes, or until crispy, tossing the tofu after 10 minutes so it cooks evenly. Or bake at 425Â°F for 20 minutes.\
