(AD/GIVEAWAY!) The cold is upon us here in Sydney and we’re officially turning to cozy winter bakes for food prep! Eeeeeee - I ADORE these single serve glass containers by the fab folks at @decoraustralia and honoured to be working with this iconic aussie brand! These are the 500ml round containers from the Vent & Seal range. Fill, bake, cool, vent, seal (yep- they’re leakproof) then take to work and then just pop-em in the microwave when you want to eat.  No more transferring containers and ruining the perfect bake! 😌 All Décor food storage containers are currently on sale at @bigwaustralia and I’m running a giveaway from my stories and broadcast channel so make sure you check it out!
