Bookmark the RECIPE:  
  
5 cups frozen mango   
1/4-1/3 cup freshly squeezed lime juice  
1/4-1/3 cup agave or honey  
  
If you want to serve these in mango halves, slice the mango and use a spoon to remove the fruit. It took about 5 mangos to get 5 cups. Transfer to a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and freeze until frozen solid (~2 hours).   
  
Add all ingredients to a food processor or blender and blend until completely smooth. This may take a minute or two since the mango is frozen. Stop to scrape down the sides in between blending to make sure everything is incorporated.   
  
Enjoy right away for a soft serve style, or scoop into mango halves and return to the freezer until set (2-3 hours).  
  
You can adjust the lime juice and agave/honey to your preference! I personally love it with lots of lime juice and just a tiny bit of sweetener. If your mango is perfectly ripe, it should be naturally sweet enough on its own!
