Soft Medjool Dates  
Natural peanut butter   
Pretzels (I used gluten-free)   
Roasted peanuts   
Chocolate chips of choice (I use dairy-free)   
  
On wax paper assemble dates.  Top with melted chocolate of choice. Chill until solid. Enjoy!!   
  
*Use pre-chilled dates. When theyâ€™re chilled they have a chewy caramel texture. This way you can just chill until the chocolate is firm - the dates take longer to reach that texture.
