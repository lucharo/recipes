What did you grow up eating for breakfast? 🌞 \
\
I usually had a hearty rice meal and very popular Filipino breakfast (but also good anytime of the day, really!) were ‘silog’ meals—“si” standing for sinangag (si) or fried garlic and itlog (log) or egg.  So if I had tocino with fried garlic rice and egg, we’d call it Tocilog/Tosilog ◡̈ \
\
