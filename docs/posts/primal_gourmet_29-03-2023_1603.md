# Blackened Snapper with Mango Salsaâ€¦ easy, healthy and bursting with flavour. Perfect meal for this incredible Miami weather. I served it with some steamed rice but you can easily keep things Paleo and Whole30 by serving it with some grilled or steamed veggies, plantains or roasted sweet potatoes. It also makes for an incredible taco!
