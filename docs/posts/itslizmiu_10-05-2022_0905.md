# The Nasi Lemak from last week! 🇲🇾 🍚 Fragrant, flavoursome, fatty and creamy - the coconut rice is the best part! Combo it with an amazing sambal and whatever else you might like to pair it with. Soooo many good vegan recipes for Nasi Lemak out there - each with their own take and twists! I can also suggest checking out these fabulous people and their recipes for it:
