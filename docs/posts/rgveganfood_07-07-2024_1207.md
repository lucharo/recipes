1 1/2 bell peppers, sliced  
1 onion, finely chopped  
2 spring onions, chopped  
4 garlic cloves, minced  
250ml plant-based double cream  
100ml coconut milk  
A few sprigs of fresh thyme or 1 tsp dried thyme   
1 scotch bonnet pepper, whole + pierced  
1 tsp all-purpose seasoning  
1/2 tsp smoked paprika  
1 tsp -1 tbsp jerk paste  
250g penne pasta  
340g ackee, drained  
2 plantains, sliced  
Parsley  
Sea salt & black pepper to taste  
  
1. On a medium heat pan, saut√© onions, spring onions, and bell peppers in a little oil for 4-5 minutes, adding garlic halfway through.  
  
2. Add plant based double cream, coconut milk, scotch bonnet, thyme, all-purpose seasoning, smoked paprika and jerk paste. Mix well and let it simmer on low heat for 8-10 minutes.  
  
3. Cook the pasta according to instructions and fry plantains in coconut oil.  
  
4. Add the cooked pasta to the cream mixture and stir well followed by the Ackee. Mix in the cooked and sliced plantains, reserving a few for garnishing later.  
  
5. Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, adding chopped parsley towards the end. Garnish with the remaining sliced plantains and additional parsley. Season with sea salt and black pepper to taste.  
  
P.S - you could just use 350ml of coconut milk/cream instead of the plant double cream.
