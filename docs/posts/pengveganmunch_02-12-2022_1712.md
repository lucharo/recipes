👇🏾INGREDIENTS👇🏾\
-10 large white potatoes \
-8 cloves of garlic\
-few sprigs of fresh thyme \
-few sprigs of fresh rosemary and \
-big pinch of salt\
-1 crushed up stock cube\
-2 tbsp nutritional yeast \
\
👇🏾METHOD👇🏾\
-add oil generously to a baking tray or dish then place in a preheated oven @200° and allow the oil to get really hot. \
-peel, dice and then wash your potatoes.\
-place the potatoes in cold salted water then bring to a boil. Once boiling has begun leave to boil for 10-15 minutes (depending on how big your tatties are).\
-once cooked, gently pour the water out of the pot then coat them in the stock cube, nutritional yeast and toss them about gently (this helps create extra crispy bits).\
-place them into the hot oiled tray/dish and add garlic, rosemary and thyme. Coat the tips of the potatoes with hot oil using a spoon then roast in the oven for 20 minutes.\
-flip the potatoes and coat the tops using a spoon then place in the oven for another 20 minutes.\
