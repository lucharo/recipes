NO MORE TOFU SLANDER AFTER THIS RECIPE. These are actually sensational teriyaki tofu bites that are crispy, remind me of nuggets, and the sauce BANGS. So save this recipe for when you wanna make a new tofu recipe🤝🔥

- 60g cornflour
- 60g breadcrumbs
- 60ml plant milk
- 4 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tbsp mirin
- 1.5 tbsp agave syrup
- 3 garlic cloves
- 2cm ginger
- 20ml boiling water
