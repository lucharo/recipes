It’s a fruit that is very versatile and it is used as a replacement for potatoes, bread and rice.

The first time I ever had breadfruit was when my uncle roasted one for me over wood fire in Jamaica 🌴 and I feel in love. Haha, yes! It’s that good!

You can boil it, bake, roast it or fry it.

Today, I’m roasting it over charcoal for 30 minutes but you prefer using the oven, you can roast at 375 F for 1 hour.

The way to know if it’s cooked and ready is when you can EASILY push a pointy knife through it and the knife comes out clean. 

Add a little vegan butter and salt to it at the end, it’s phenomenal ♥️
