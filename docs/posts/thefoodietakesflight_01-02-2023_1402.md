I love using a mix of zucchini, cabbage, carrots, and some green onions but you can really add other vegetables of your choice.  
  
👉🏼the full recipe for these pancakes + dipping sauce are over on my website thefoodietakesflight.com or you can also click on the link in my bio @thefoodietakesflight (search for ‘vegetable pancakes’) 🥢  
  
Wishing you all a great month ahead!! Also how is January already over 🥲
