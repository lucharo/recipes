Fresh galangal is difficult to come by in Manila ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ so Iâ€™m rly grateful for this plant no growing in my backyard ðŸŒ¿

Tom yum essentials:
- Galangal (tho Iâ€™ve made it with ginger + bit of pepper in the past, BUT galangal rly is the best still)
- Kaffir/makrut lime leaves
- Lemongrass
- Plus off a few other key ingredients!
