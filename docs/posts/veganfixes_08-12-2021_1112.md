I know you probably have that one lonely overripe banana sitting on your counter and youâ€™re not sure what to do with it so here is the ultimate overripe banana savior - single serving banana bread thatâ€™s super easy to make and tastes like the real deal. 

Ingredients:
ğŸ’› 1 overripe banana (~100g)
ğŸ’› 5g (1 tsp) peanut butter
ğŸ’› 20ml (4 tsp) dairy-free milk
ğŸ’› sweetener ( @myvegan toffee flavdrops, 1 tbsp brown sugar, coconut sugar, sugar substitute,â€¦)
ğŸ’› 40g (5 tbsp) flour 
ğŸ’› pinch of salt
ğŸ’› pinch of cinnamon
ğŸ’› 1/2 tsp baking powder
ğŸ’› optional but not really: chocolate chips 

Bake on 180Â°C / 350Â°F for 20 minutes. 

Enjoy!
Tag me if you make this! Iâ€™d love to see your remakes! ğŸ¥°
