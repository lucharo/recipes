Hello people and welcome back to \#larderlootin where I show you a staple ingredient from the cupboard that I use heaps in my cooking and this week it’s firm tofu!   
  
I made this delicious dish that traditionally is made with chicken but I seared and seasoned the tofu like you would a chicken breast and made the famous Peruvian green sauce to drizzle on top.  
  
Ingredients   
For the tofu chicken:  
1 block of firm tofu  
1 tbsp smoked paprika  
1 tsp cayenne pepper  
1 tsp oregano  
1 tsp cumin  
Sea salt   
Oil  
  
For the Peruvian green sauce:  
1 cup fresh coriander  
1 tbsp jalapeños   
Juice and zest of 2 limes  
2 tbsp vegan mayo  
Glut of olive oil  
Salt and pepper  
1 clove garlic  
  
For the rice:  
1 cup cooked rice  
1 onion  
2 cloves garlic  
3/4 cup of the Peruvian green sauce  
2 cups frozen peas  
Juice of half lemon  
1 tsp chilli flakes  
Fresh salad  
  
Method:  
1. Start by blitzing together the green sauce ingredients and blend until smooth and set aside.  
2. Now oil and season your tofu so it’s fully coated then grab a skillet over medium to high heat and sear the tofu on all sides for 3/4 minutes until it’s charred.  
3. Now in a separate pan fry off your onions and garlic until fragrant and then go in with the chilli flakes, lemon and frozen peas.  
4. Add your cooked rice and the green sauce and heat through for a few minutes.  
5. Serve up the rice in a bowl, top with some fresh salad and the Peruvian tofu and then a drizzle of that green sauce and enjoy!!
