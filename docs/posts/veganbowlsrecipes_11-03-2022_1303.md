# DAN DAN NOODLES (æ“”æ“”éºµ) #VEGAN.ðŸ¥¢Quite possibly one of the greatest Sichuan dishes to ever live. This is a Taiwanese take. Nothing like a spicy, nutty, and umami bowl of noodles on a cold winter day â€” one slurp will warm you right up & tuck you into bed. I can confirm because Iâ€™m still on the floor right now.ðŸ˜Œ By @chez.jorge
