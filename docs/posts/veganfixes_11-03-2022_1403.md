# ðŸŒ±High-Protein Red Lentil Dip/Sandwich Spread (oil-free option)ðŸŒ±ðŸ¤” by @cookingforpeanuts Can you still call this hummus if it doesnâ€™t have chickpeas? Hummus literally means chickpeasâ€¦so no. But I use it like I would hummus. I replaced the chickpeas with higher-protein red lentils, which makes things a bit easier! ðŸª´Iâ€™m on vacation so posting less this week. But will make it up to you soon!

âœ…Serves 4\
âœ…Ingredients:\
1 cup dried red lentils\
Â¼ cup tahini\
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (about 1 small lemon)\
2 tablespoons olive oil or water\
1 large garlic clove\
Â¼ teaspoon ground ginger\
Â½ teaspoon ground cumin\
Â¼ teaspoon turmeric\
Â¼ teaspoon onion powder\
Â¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper\
Salt & freshly ground black pepper to taste\
âœ…Rinse the lentils under cold water until the water runs clear. In a medium saucepan, cover the lentils with water to a depth of about 2 inches. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook covered for about 15 minutes, or until the lentils are just tender. Drain any excess water using a sieve.\
âœ…Place the lentils, tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, ginger powder, cumin, turmeric, onion powder, and cayenne into a food processor. Pulse until smooth, adding water as needed until the desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper. \
