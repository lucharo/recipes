I developed this recipe over a year ago and it hasn’t stopped receiving love from you ever since. It’s been such an honor seeing you make this recipe, so I decided to give it a little upgrade technique-wise.   
  
I created step by step guides to help you visualize the process a little better. The recipe remains pretty much the same, but I redesigned it to fit a bigger pan (as per your request).  
  
Can’t wait to see all the new versions of this well-loved dessert. Check out the link in my bio to get the recipe from my website.
