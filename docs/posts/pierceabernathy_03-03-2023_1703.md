Ingredients:  
1 small spaghetti squash  
Olive oil   
Kosher salt  
  
Sauce//  
10oz celeriac, peeled and cut into 1” cubes  
1.5 oz shallot  
2 cloves garlic  
1 tsp kosher salt   
2 tbsp salted butter  
1 cup grated parmesan plus more to garnish   
Aggressive amount of freshly cracked black pepper   
  
Preparation:  
1. Preheat the oven to 425F/220C.  
2. Cut squash in half and remove seeds. Save for another use. Transfer squash onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Season with olive oil and salt and place skin side up. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until tender. Remove and allow to cool slightly. Use a fork to remove squash from skin and transfer to a bowl. Set aside.  
3. Place celeriac, shallot, garlic, and salt in a medium size pot. Cover with a generous amount of water. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook until the celeriac is extremely tender, about 20 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a blender along with some of the cooking liquid. Blend until smooth sauce forms. Set aside and reserve cooking liquid.  
4. In a large saucepan on medium heat, add roughly half of the celeriac sauce along with the butter. Stir to combine. Add the grated Parmesan and black pepper and stir to combine. If too thick, add a few splashes of the celeriac cooking liquid.   
5. Add in the squash and stir to combine. Taste and adjust for salt if desired.  
6. Immediately transfer to a bowl and garnish with more grated parmesan, freshly cracked black pepper, and olive oil.
