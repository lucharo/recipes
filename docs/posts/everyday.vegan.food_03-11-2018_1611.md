# Orange tofu! 🔥🙌🏼 It’s so good that I’m not ashamed to tell you this is what I had for breakfast this morning lol! (Someone has to eat the leftovers right?!😂) I hope you like it! ☺️ It doesn’t taste overly like orange, if you want that powerful orange flavor, use store-bought orange juice! But I prefer using fresh ingredients and I like the subtle orange flavor! ☺️ I didn’t add too much sugar, just 2 tbsp so make sure to adjust the sauce to your preference once it’s done! 💚🔥 Orange Tofu

.
Ingredients:
Extra firm tofu (14 oz/397g)
2 tbsp cornstarch (16g)
.
The sauce:
1/2 cup + 1 tbsp Freshly squeezed orange juice (140ml)
orange zest to taste
2 tbsp tamari (30ml)
2 tbsp coconut sugar
2 tsp sriracha
1 tsp seasoned rice vinegar
1 tbsp cornstarch (5g) + a little bit of water
.
Instructions:
.
1. Cube the tofu and place in a large bowl. Sprinkle on the cornstarch and toss to combine. 
2. Coat the bottom of a large skillet with a bit of oil if using and place over medium-high heat. Add tofu cubes and cook a few minutes on each side, until browned and crispy. Make sure they do not touch so they do not stick to each other. Crisp and brown on all sides and set aside.

3. In a large pan, add all sauce ingredients except the cornstarch and water. Mix the cornstarch and water in a small bowl to combine, and then add to the pan. Whisk over medium-low heat constantly until the sauce thickens. 
4. Now add the crispy tofu to the saucepan and stir to coat the tofu in the sauce.
5. Serve as desired.
