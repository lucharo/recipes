# KFC Style Crusted Jackfruit by @plantcrazii Young green jackfruit has a meat like texture & look to it that truly has my mind blown! After battering and frying them, I dipped these crusted beauties in sweet chili sauce & hot Buffalo sauce! For the batter, I remember going to a vegan festival and having really good battered fried mushrooms and when I asked the vendor what egg substitute she used, she told me milk + vinegar(let it sit for 15 minutes) and that’s all so that is what I did!
