# Ginger #Tempeh Bowl! 🥒😍 Add rice or quinoa and a sauce of your choice, to turn this into a buddha bowl if you'd like.😋 Or keep it as is, for a light lunch! 🌿 Or, you could add more greens instead and turn this into a salad with a dressing of your choice. (Even just kale massaged with lemon juice and mixed with avocado would be amazing!) ⠀
