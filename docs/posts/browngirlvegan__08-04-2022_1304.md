This is another rendition of my peanut chilli noodles, but instead I wanted something that was zesty, tangy and spicy all at the same time. And let's just take a moment to appreciate knife cut noodles...the texture and taste is insane! you've got to try it üòç\
\
I used mild pepper chilli flakes but feel free to use any spice level you'd like! For a gluten free option, you can either you brown rice noodles or rice noodles. More \#dEATs below: \
\
Ingredients: \
1 packet of knife-cut noodles\
Handful of cilantro \
1 tbsp red pepper flakes (mild/hot) - i used gochugaru\

1 tbsp soy sauce\
1/2 tbsp rice vinegar\
1/2 tbsp lime juice \
1 tsp maple syrup \
