GUYZZZZ these are so peng. Omg.
Oyster mushrooms are the best chicken replacement hands down. The texture and juicyness is perfection.
And the sauce…. THE SAUCE. Gahhhh you try this!

 For the batter:
(Wet ingredients)
* 1 cup unsweetened soy milk & 1/2 tbsp vinegar (i used apple cider vinegar)
(Dry ingredients)
* 1 cup plain flour
* 1 tsp garlic granules
* 1 tsp salt

Sauce:
4 cloves of crushed garlic
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp sriracha
2 tbsp agave (or maple syrup if you don’t have)
2 tbsp water

150g box of oyster mushrooms (I got mine from @marksandspencerfood )

- For the batter combine the plant milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside for 5 mins (makes vegan buttermilk) 
- Then mix the dry ingredients in another bowl
- Pull apart the oyster mushrooms and dunk/cover each piece into the wet then the dry, back to the wet and into the dry for the 2nd time (makes them extra crispy to batter twice!)
- Deep fry until golden and crispy
- Put on a rack and pat off any excess oil
- Combine all sauce ingredients and heat in a pan until it reduces and becomes thick and sticky as shown
- When it’s ready add lotsa chopped fresh coriander and mix it in 
- Coat each wing in the sauce and enjoy!!
