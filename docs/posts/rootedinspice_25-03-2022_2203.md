Roasted Garlic & Red Pepper Baingan Bharta  
Serves: 2  
  
// INGREDIENTS //  
- 1 large / 2 medium eggplants, cut in half  
- 1 red bell pepper, quartered or just stem and seeds removed  
- 1 head of garlic, slice top head of garlic to expose cloves  
- 1/2 red onion, finely diced  
- 2 green chilies (+/-), finely chopped  
- 2 large tomatoes, diced (or I used half a 14oz can of diced tomatoes)  
- 1/2 tsp mustard seeds  
- 1/4 tsp turmeric  
- 1/2 tsp kashmiri red chili powder  
- 1/2 tsp coriander powder  
- Salt to taste  
- Chopped cilantro for garnish  
- Small wedge of lemon (if needed)  
  
// RECIPE //  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Coat eggplant, red pepper, and garlic in a bit of oil, place on baking tray skin side up (cover the garlic in foil), and roast at 450F for 20 min or until the eggplant collapses and then broiler for 5 min (everyone's oven strength is different so keep a close eye on it and take it out when the bell pepper is charred).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Cover the red pepper in small bowl to sweat and set aside. Scoop out the eggplant, eliminating any extra water and mashing it well, and then squeeze and smash in the roasted garlic with the eggplant. Once the red pepper has cooled down, remove the skin and dice.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ In a pan, heat up some olive oil and add mustard seeds, when they start popping, add onion and green chilies and saut√© for 2 min.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Add spices, salt, and tomatoes and cook until tomatoes are completely softened and jammy.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Then add in eggplant/garlic mixture and red pepper. Mix and cook for 2 min.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ Taste for salt, add a small squeeze of lemon if needed, and garnish with cilantro!
