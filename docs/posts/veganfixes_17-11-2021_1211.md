‚Å£\
Have you ever craved a cinnamon roll but didn‚Äôt want to bake an entire batch or wait for yeast to rise? Well you‚Äôve come to the right place ü§™ I used pantry staples from @thesourcewestendbrisbane + @macr0mike protein to create this!‚ú® Here is the recipe ‚û°Ô∏è‚Å£\
‚Å£\
Makes: 1 (cal: 260, P: 23g, C:30g, F: 5g )‚Å£\
‚Å£\
INGREDIENTS:‚Å£\
‚úÖ2 tablespoons (30g) self-raising flour + extra for rolling ‚Å£\
‚úÖ2 tablespoons vegan salted caramel protein powder ( I used @macr0mike - discount code ‚Äúamb-chen‚Äù )‚Å£\
‚úÖ3 tablespoons non-dairy yoghurt (I used cashew) ‚Å£\
‚úÖ1/2 teaspoon cinnamon ‚Å£\
‚úÖ 2 teaspoons granulated sweetener‚Å£\
‚úÖ Coconut oil, melted for greasing ‚Å£\
‚Å£\
Protein Icing: ‚Å£\
‚úÖ 1 teaspoon vegan salted caramel protein powder ‚Å£\
‚úÖ 1 teaspoon icing sugar ‚Å£\
‚úÖ Dash of water until desired consistency ‚Å£\
‚Å£\
METHOD:‚Å£\
1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius, fan-forced. Grease the base of a small ramekin (mine was 8cm in diameter) ‚Å£\
2. In a bowl, mix together the flour and protein powder. Add in the yoghurt and knead until a ball of dough forms.‚Å£\
3. Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough into a long rectangle (~3cm x 20cm) (see image 2)‚Å£\
4. Combine the coconut sugar & cinnamon together in a small dish. Brush the surface of the dough with a thin layer of melted coconut oil. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the dough.‚Å£\
5. Roll the dough up into a log. Place it in the prepared ramekin (see image 3)‚Å£\
6. Bake for 15-17 mins until golden and risen. ‚Å£\
7. In the meantime, make the icing: in a small bowl, whisk together the ingredients until no lumps remain. Add just enough water to achieve a thick yet pourable consistency.‚Å£\
8. Drizzle the icing over the roll and serve!‚Å£\
