Many people loved the tamarind drink I shared on Tuesday so here is a creative way to use up some of the tamarind drink  
  
For 2 glasses   
- 2 tbsp simple syrup (or any syrup of choice)   
- 2/3 cup tamarind ginger juice   
- ice   
- a few mint leaves   
- lot of ice  
- about 1 cup of lime flavoured sparkling water   
- for the spicy rim, I used about 1 tsp of sea salt and 1 tsp of chilli powder
