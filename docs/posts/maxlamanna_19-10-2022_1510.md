‚ù§Ô∏èSave, share and tag friend!

My grandmother has only made me one thing in her entire 94 years on Earth and it‚Äôs BANANA BREAD! This is her recipe but veganised.

‚¨áÔ∏èYou need to try this‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs how to make this delicious banana bread!

70g aquafaba from tinned chickpeas
240g gluten-free plain flour or regular flour
2 ripe bananas, mashed and 1 ripe banana for decoration 
10g neutral oil
60g vegan butter, melted
120g light brown sugar
Zest of lemon
2 tsp vanilla extract or almond extract
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
2 tsp mixed spices
50g mixed nuts
100g dark chocolate chips 

To make the vegan buttermilk:
90ml plant-based milk
2 tbsp lemon juice

Stir the ingredients together and sit for a few minutes.

Pre heat oven to 175C (350F)

Whisk the aquafaba for 3-5 minutes until it‚Äôs foamy and volume increases. 

In a mixing bowl, add the oil, butter and sugar whisk to combine. Next, add the sugar mixture to the whipped aquafaba, almond extract, vegan buttermilk and 3 mashed bananas. Then combine the flour, baking soda, salt, lemon zest, chocolate chips and walnuts.

Pour the mixture in a lined loaf tin and carefully lay the sliced banana on top with a sprinkle of brown sugar. Bake in the oven for roughly 45-50 minutes. 

Allow the bread to cool before slicing.

Enjoy!
