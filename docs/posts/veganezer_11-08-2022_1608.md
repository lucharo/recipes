Had to hook up with the boy @johnnymeatless again to bring you these succulent bites with a delicious sauce, that will have you fighting for the next dip ü§™  
  
‚≠êÔ∏èINGREDIENTS‚≠êÔ∏è  
- 200g oyster mushrooms   
- 1 cup soya milk   
- 1/2 small lemon, juiced   
- 1 cup flour  
- 1 tsp lemon pepper seasoning   
- 1 tsp chilli flakes   
- 1 tsp garlic powder  
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper   
- 1 tsp old bay seasoning   
- 1 tsp white pepper   
- Pinch of salt   
- 1/2 cup vg mayo @heinz_uk  
- 1 tbsp sriracha   
- 1 tbsp maple syrup   
- 1 tsp mustard   
- Oil for frying   
  
‚≠êÔ∏èMETHOD‚≠êÔ∏è  
- Mix together in a bowl the milk and lemon juice, set aside for 5mins.   
- In another bowl add the flour, lemon pepper, chilli, garlic, cayenne, old bay, pepper and salt.   
- Dip the oyster mushrooms into the wet mix then the dry. Repeat this step of you want it crunchy.   
- Heat up some oil, once hot at the mushrooms into the pan (lay away from you). Fry for a few minutes on each side then remove.   
- After 5 minutes add the mushrooms back into the oil for a second fry. (Believe is this gets it crunchy).   
- Add the mayo, sriracha, maple syrup and mustard into a sauce jar and mix.   
- Once the mushrooms are done. Serve up and enjoy!
