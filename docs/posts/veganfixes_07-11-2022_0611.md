If you‚Äôre looking for cosy comfort food, you NEED to try this spicy miso mushroom ramen this weekend üòç \
\
Recipe serves 2: \
300g mixed mushrooms \
1 tsp sesame oil \
1 tsp soy sauce \
\
2 cloves of garlic, grated or minced \
1 1/2 tbsp miso \
1 tbsp chilli paste (I used gochujang) \
2 tsp tomato puree \
600ml veg stock \
200ml soya milk \
2 portions of vegan noodles\
2 pak choi\
3 spring onions \
\
To serve (optional): \
Chilli oil \
Chilli flakes \
Sesame seeds\
\
Slice the mushrooms. Add the sesame oil and soy sauce to the pot you‚Äôre going to use to make the broth and put onto a medium heat. Add the mushrooms, trying not to move them about too much. Once golden, remove from the pot and put to one side. Don‚Äôt worry if there‚Äôs a few bits left in the pan. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Add the garlic to the pot with a tablespoon of water. Soften for a minute or so and then add the miso, chilli paste and tomato puree. Mix well to form a thick paste and then add the veg stock and soya milk. Simmer over the heat for around 5 minutes until slightly reduced. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Add the noodles to the broth and leave to cook as per pack instructions. Meanwhile, finely slice the spring onion and pak choi. You can add a splash more hot water to the noodles if needed (some will soak up more broth than others). ‚Ä®‚Ä®Once cooked, serve the noodles and broth, top with the pak choi and spring onion and top with chilli oil, chilli flakes and sesame seeds if using. Enjoy! üíõ
