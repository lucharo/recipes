# PANDAN COCONUT PANCAKES or KUIH DADAR GULUNG (KETAYAP)! 🇮🇩🇲🇾These thin pandan flavoured crêpes are rolled with the juiciest palm sugar and shredded coconut filling and my version is egg-free! (Also before the pancake police roll out - all crepes are pancakes but all pancakes are not crepes 🫡)

Pandan Juice  
1/2 cup water  
35g Pandan leaves   
  
Batter  
150g plain flour  
1/2 tsp salt  
1/4 tsp baking powder  
350ml @chefschoicefoods coconut milk  
1 tbsp vegetable oil  
1/4 cup pandan juice  
1/4-1/2 tsp pandan flavouring  
  
Filling  
100g gula melaka (palm sugar)**  
1/4 cup pandan juice  
50g Dried Shredded Coconut mixed with 1/4 cup water (or 1/2 cup freshly grated coconut)  
  
**⚠️PSA: PALM SUGAR DOES NOT COME FROM THE SAME PALM AS PALM OIL! It’s literally coconut palm sugar and it’s bloody delicious. Try to find real gula malaka not just any coconut sugar because it’s not too dark, not too light and so mellow and yum.   
  
Start by making your pandan juice. Blend water and pandan leaves then strain in a cheese cloth to get pandan juice. In a large mixing bowl sift in the flour, add salt and baking powder and whisk to combine. Add @chefschoicefoods coconut milk, pandan juice, oil and flavouring and whisk til you have a smooth batter.  
  
In a small saucepan add the pandan juice and palm sugar and heat until sugar is just dissolved. Add your hydrated coconut and cook until sticky. Turn heat off and set aside  
  
In a non-stick pan brush or spray a VERY LIGHT layer of oil, too much and the edges will get too crispy (a little bit of crisp is okay as they should soften). Heat pan on low heat until hot. I recommend doing a test pancake first. Pour 1/3 cup scoop of batter into the middle and swirl into a circle. Cook for a few minutes, flip, then cook until just set. Place onto a plate. It should be a thin crepe - if it’s too thick add a little water. If your pancake is tearing or breaking, add 2 tsp of flour to the batter and do another test pancake. Cook all your crepes and stack them - any crispier edges should mostly soften.   
  
To roll, place 1-2 tbsp of filling into your cooled pancakes, tuck in the sides and roll up. Serve immediately!
