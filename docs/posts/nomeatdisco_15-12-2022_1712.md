This is my first time trying this recipe so me and @sepps_eats thought we would give it a go together. Itâ€™s definitely one of my favorite desserts Iâ€™ve made to date.   
  
You really do only need a few ingredients too!   
  
Ingredients  
1 pack of puff pastry   
A bag of apples (I used cooking apples)  
200g Caster sugar  
1 Tsp sea salt  
50g vegan butter  
  
Method:  
1. Start by peeling and coring your apple and chopping them in half.  
2. Add the sugar to a skillet with 50ml of water and melt the sugar then turn up the heat so it starts to bubble and becomes a caramel. But donâ€™t let it go too dark as it will burn.  
3. Once silky turn off the heat and add in the butter and it should foam up. Then sprinkle with sea salt.  
4. Now arrange the apples with the cut side facing up into the caramel sauce in a nice pattern and making sure you fill all the gaps. Put the pan over a gentle heat for 5 more mins.   
5. Layer over the puff pastry and cut around the skillet and crimp the edges.  
6. Now wack the oven on at 220C and bake the tarte tatin for 30 mins until the patty is golden. Flip the pan over onto a plate and you should have the perfect tarte tatin! Serve with cream or ice cream and enjoy!!
