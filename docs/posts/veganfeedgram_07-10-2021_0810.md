They’re are a combination of two of my favourite things combined… Dumplings & Rice Paper rolls!  
  
They’re crispy on the outside, soft & chewy inside 😋😋  
  
This recipe for Rice Paper Dumplings is also vegan and gluten free so everyone can enjoy them!  
You can also switch you the filling to your fav veggies & protein too!
