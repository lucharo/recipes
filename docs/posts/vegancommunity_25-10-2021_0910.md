Check out Ben & Roxy's amazing recipe below:  
  
Serves 4  
  
ğŸŒ¿ 320g / 11.3oz pasta  
ğŸŒ¿ 70g / 2.5oz pistachios, shells removed  
ğŸŒ¿ 2 garlic cloves  
ğŸŒ¿ 3 tbsp nutritional yeast  
ğŸŒ¿ 2 bunches of fresh basil, stalks removed  
ğŸŒ¿ 1 handful of fresh mint, stalks removed  
ğŸŒ¿ 1/4 tsp chilli flakes  
ğŸŒ¿ 1 lime, juice only  
ğŸŒ¿ 150ml / 5.1 fl.oz extra virgin olive oil  
ğŸŒ¿ salt + pepper  
  
Cook the pasta in salted boiling water until al dente, then drain and reserve the pasta water  
  
Add the remaining ingredients to a food processor including 1/2 tsp salt and a generous pinch of pepper.  
  
Process until smooth. When the pasta has finished cooking, add 2-3 tbsp of the paster water to help reduce the thickness of the pesto.  
  
Combine the pasta and the pesto. We like to top with freshly ground black pepper and a few basil and mint leaves.  
  
Enjoy!
