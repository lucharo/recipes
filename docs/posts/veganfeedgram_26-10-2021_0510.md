I guess you have all ingredients for this at home, so definitely try it ASAP! 😇\

-1 Tbsp cocoa powder \
-1/2 Tbsp ground flax seeds (optional)\
-2 Tbsp sweetener of your choice \
-2/3 cup (160ml) plant milk\
-1/2 Tsp baking powder\
BLEND all ingredients until smooth/BAKE at 175Celsius/350Fahrenheit for 20-25min
