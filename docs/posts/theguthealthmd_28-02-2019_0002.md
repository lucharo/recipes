Before we start... Shout out 🗣 to @fivesechealth - who you should all be following. I don’t know that she literally invented it, but she’s the Queen 👸🏼of Nice Cream.
. 
Let’s talk about sugar 🍬 for a sec. A friend asked, “Aren’t all sugars 🍩🍇 the same? They have the same calories.” We know now it’s WAY more complicated than that. Although similar, the sugar in bananas 🍌 (mostly fructose) isn’t even the same compound as white sugar 🍬 (sucrose) or the sugar made primarily in fermentation🍺 (maltose).
.
On top of these differences, foods are more than the sum of their parts, so for your body, fructose in a banana ≠ the fructose in high fructose corn syrup 🌽. The sugar in fruit comes with fiber, vitamins, minerals, & phytochemicals that behave synergistically. This is why they actually PREVENT diabetes. See my last post! 👀
. 
The gut does a pretty cool job of showing how food is more than calories. Foods WITHOUT calories can be worse than sugar 🍭. One study 📖 done on the effects of artificial sweeteners on the microbiome demonstrated that artificial sweeteners, when compared to normal sugar, led to glucose intolerance by messing with the microbiome, while other studies have found an association 📈 between artificial sweetener consumption and weight gain. ⚖️
.
Bottom line: WHOLE FOODS is the way to go.
.
DIRECTIONS: 
Extra ripe frozen bananas 🍌, a splash of nut milk, and a teaspoon of vanilla in the  blender and BZZZZ 🌪. Add melted dark chocolate, berries, granola, and nuts or nut butter. 🍨 TAG ME IF YOU TRY THIS!

🤔 What would you eat on YOUR banana 🍌 nice cream?
