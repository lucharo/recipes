\
Translating roughly to ‘mixed rice’, this Korean rice bowl is so tasty + has so much colour thanks to the variety of fresh vegetables, dressings + garnishes 🌈 \
\
I used tofu as my protein but I also use vegan mince alternatives with the same marinade (- water) + you can also add some pickled daikon too 🔥 \
\
This was in my top 3 meals of 2021 + will probably be top 3 of ‘22 as well 📈\
\
Hope you enjoy 😊 \
