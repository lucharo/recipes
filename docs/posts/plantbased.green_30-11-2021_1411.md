I love these snacks/treats that you can perfectly eat in higher amounts without feeling bad afterwards... Perfect for a busy work day, trips, potlucks or pretty much any other occasion 😋

RECIPE (12 brownies)
- 1 large sweet potato
- 1/2 cup (125 g) nut butter (I used almond)
- 1/2 cup (40 g) cacao powder
- 1 cup (150 g) dates (sub with maple or sugar)
- 1/3 cup flour of choice (I used oat flour)
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- pinch of salt
- 1/3 cup dark chocolate chips (optional)
- handful pecans (optional
⠀
❶ Soak dates in hot water. Bake, steam or microwave the sweet potato until soft.
❷ Blend dates, sweet potato and nut butter. If using other sweetener you can skip this and simply mash the sweet potato in a bowl.
❸ In a bowl mix the dry ingredients, add the blended ingredients to the bowl and combine. Optionally fold in some dark chocolate and add the dough to a baking dish. 
❹ Add some chocolate and pecans on top and bake at 180°C for 30-35 minutes. 
❺ Let the brownies cool completely before slicing.
