1. Preheat oven to 350F and grease a baking dish.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder, then stir in the butter and milk.
3. Add a small amount of flour to your surface and roll the dough into a rectangle.
4. In another bowl, stir together the filling ingredients, then spread over the dough until it’s fully covered.
5. Roll it up, cut into 8-9 small cinnamon rolls, and bake for 23- 25 minutes! {Topped with frosting and extra cinnamon}
