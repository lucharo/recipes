2 INGREDIENT OREO ICE CREAM - all you need are Oreos and cream for this fun summer treat  
  
Ingredients (5-6 popsicles)  
  
2 cups heavy cream  
1 x 14.3 oz (405 g) pack of oreos   
  
Instructions   
  
1. Heat the heavy cream in a microwave for 1 minute or on the stove, in a pan over medium heat until warm. You donâ€™t need it to simmer, it needs to be warm, not hot. Add in 12 crushed oreo cookies. Mix until the mixture looks grey-ish brown.   
  
2. Add the mixture into popsicle molds. Freeze until solid, for about 5-6 hours.   
  
3. Scoop the filling out of 25 oreos. Melt the white filling in a microwave, for 30 seconds, or until liquid. Add the remaining cookies in a plastic bag and crush using a rolling pin.   
  
4. Pull out each popsicle, drizzle some Oreo filling, then dip into Oreo crumbs. Drizzle remaining filling on top.   
  
5. Serve right away or store in the freezer.
