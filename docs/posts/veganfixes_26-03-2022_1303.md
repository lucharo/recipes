Recipe (makes 4 servings)  
2 medium sweet potatoes  
1 tbsp olive oil  
Pinch of salt  
10 oz pasta of choice  
2 cups plant milk  
1/4 cup nutritional yeast  
1/2 cup coconut cream  
1 tbsp mustard  
1 tsp paprika  
1 tsp cumin  
1/2 tsp black pepper  
Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C/350 F. Peel the sweet potatoes and chop them into bite-sized pieces. Transfer them to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and season with sea salt. Roast for around 25 minutes. Cook pasta of your choice according to instructions on packaging. Transfer the sweet potato to a blender or food processor together with all the other ingredients and blend until smooth. Pour the sauce into a frying pan over a low-medium heat and add the pasta. Stir together for a couple of minutes, until warmed through.
