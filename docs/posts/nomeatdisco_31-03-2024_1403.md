Who finds jerk too spicy?   
  
We back with another Lions mane banger and another outdoor eats!   
  
Happy Easter everyone, this is way better way to spend Easter right?   
  
Ingredients  
1 lions mane mushroom (can use Portabello)   
For the jerk marinade:  
1 tsp jerk paste (I used @tropicalsunfoods )  
1 tbsp maple syrup  
1 tbsp hot sauce (I used @lesleyssauces )  
1 tbsp mushroom ketchup (I used @geo.watkins )  
Drizzle of oil  
  
For the pineapple salsa  
1 pineapple  
Half a white onion  
1 bunch parsley   
1 sweet red pepper  
Juice of a lime  
  
Tortilla   
Spicy mayo to top  
  
Method:  
1. Start by grilling the pineapple and red pepper on the bbq until charred. Season to taste.  
2. Add the mushroom to the grill and season and press. Mix together the jerk marinade and brush on the marinade to the mushroom on both sides.   
3. Add the onion, red pepper and pineapple to a bowl, with lime, olive oil and salt and mix.  
4. Brush some of the jerk marinade onto the tortilla and then grill on the bbq for a few minutes.  
5. Slice up the jerk mushroom and build up the taco.
