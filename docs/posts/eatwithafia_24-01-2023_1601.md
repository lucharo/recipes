# ✨Tatale✨ is one of the best ways to use over ripe plantains. They are the pan fried version of akakro/kaklo and are absolutely delicious. It is traditionally served with bambara beans (these are groundnut like peanuts that grow in the ground but taste like chickpeas) it is a delicious combo, and traditionally vegan friendly. The full recipe for the tatale is on my blog.
