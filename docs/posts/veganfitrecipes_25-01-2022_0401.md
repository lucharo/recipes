You need:  
500g potatoes  
300g sweet potato  
1 onion, red  
2 zucchini  
200ml oat cream  
100ml oat milk  
1.5 tsp salt  
1/2 tsp black pepper, ground  
1 pinch nutmeg  
1 pack of SoCheeze from @sofine.deutschland  
  
The preparation couldn't be easier: Wash or peel the vegetables and cut them into fine slices [with a food processor or slicer], place in the mold [ordered as in the video or wildly mixed up], pour the cream from the remaining ingredients over it and top with the grated 🌱cheese topping Bake for about 1 hour at 180 degrees and you're done 👩‍🍳👩‍🍳  
  
Which one of you has ever conjured up a vegan gratin? I used to love it as a child and the plant-based version is in no way inferior! 😍
