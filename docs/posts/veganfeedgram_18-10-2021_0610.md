 \
3️⃣ Meanwhile, to prepare the chimichurri, add the parsley, garlic, red chilli, shallot, dried oregano, red wine vinegar and large pinches of salt and pepper to a mixing bowl, along with 6 tbsp of olive oil. Stir to combine\
 \
4️⃣ Remove the potatoes from the oven and drizzle the chimichurri all over. So delicious!\

Notes:\
👉 We use extra virgin olive oil in the chimichurri, which makes the dressing slightly lighter and has a stronger olive flavour\
\
👉 Taste the chimichurri dressing as you go and the ingredients to your taste. Add more chilli if you like it hot or less vinegar if you prefer it less tangy\
\
👉 Make sure you use a large baking tray so you’ve got enough space to smash the potatoes.\
\
👉 The dressing is traditionally made using fresh oregano, but dried oregano is far easier to find where we live
