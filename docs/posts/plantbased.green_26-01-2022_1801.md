I could eat this every day!  
  
Tired of the same tofu recipe?  
  
This is smoky, crispy and goes well in lots of recipes, from a pasta sauce to tacos and so much more.

Recipe:  
Serves: 2-4  
Time: 20-25 minutes  
  
450g extra firm tofu  
3 tbsp soy sauce/ tamari   
3 tbsp olive oil  
1 tsp garlic powder  
1 tsp paprika   
1 tsp chili powder  
2 tbsp nutritional yeast  
  
Pre heat oven to 400F/ 200C  
  
Remove excess water from the tofu.  
  
In a bowl, add the remaining ingredients and mix together to create a paste.   
  
Once tofu is drained and any excess water has been removed, squeeze the tofu in your hands to create a crumbly texture.   
  
Lightly drizzle a small amount of oil onto a baking tray and then add the “ground beef” - spread evenly.   
  
Bake in the oven for 20 minutes. I removed mine after 17 minutes.   
  
Perfect for pasta sauces, tacos, chillis, shepherd’s pie and so much more.   
  
🥶Freeze for 1 month  
  
What should I cook next? Any suggestions?
