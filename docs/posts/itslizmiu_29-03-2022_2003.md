\
EASY HASHBROWNS \
600g potato\
1 tsp salt\
1/3-1/2 cup cornstarch \
\
Peel, wash and grate your potatoes then rinse really really REALLY well in cold water. Try to drain out as much water as humanely possible then dry between two tea towels. Cook potato and salt in some oil for 4-5 mins until potato gets tender but not mushy - it’ll start to look kinda glassy. (Cooking the potato first basically means the potato doesn’t have to cook when you fry it, and just needs to get crispy) Transfer to a bowl and mix with cornstarch. Mixture may feel dry and that’s okay, but should clump together when you squeeze tightly. Working with the warm mix, squeeze small handfuls into nuggets and then squish flat. Freeze overnight. You don’t have to double fry but it does make them EXXXTRA crispy! Deep fry at 160°C for a few mins. Then deep fry at 190°C for a few mins. For single fey just deep fry at 190°C til golden brown! \
