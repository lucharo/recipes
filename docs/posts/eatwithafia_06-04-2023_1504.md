# We are making Ugandan Rolex for breakfast today. A relatively inexpensive street-side snack with an expensive name. I have been making a ton of chapatis these past few weeks for various recipes, so when @justegg was on sale, I jumped at the opportunity to make this dish. Rolex probably gets its name from Rolled Eggs rather than the watch and itâ€™s just another example of culinary mixing in Eastern Africa.

Recipe  
  
Chapati (make about 4 chapatis)  
- 210 g of all-purpose flour (1.5 cups)  
- 5g salt (1 tsp salt)  
- 3g sugar (1 tsp sugar)  
- 26g oil (2 tbsp) I used avocado but any neutral oil works  
- 100g water (0.5 cups)  
  
Rolex  
- 1 small onion  
- 1/3 bell pepper  
- 1/3 cup of shredded cabbage  
- 1/3 of a carrot chopped  
- 1/2 cup just egg  
- vegetable oil  
- 1 tomato  
- 1/2 avocado  
- a pinch of salt  
- pepper to taste  
  
1. Mix the chapati ingredients together and knead for about 5-10 minutes till nice and soft. Let the dough rest for an hour.   
2. As the chapati dough is resting, chop all your veggies into tiny pieces. Set the veggies aside.   
3. Divide your chapati dough into four balls and roll each ball into a thin chapati about 10 inch by 10 inch.   
4. Heat your pan at medium heat with 2 tsp of oil. Once it is nice and hot, lay one chapati in the pan. Let the chapati cook till the entire top starts to get translucent and air bubble starts forming on the chapati. Flip the chapati and let it cook for about 1-2 minutes on the other side.   
5. Remove the cooked chapati and set aside  
6. Pour another tsp of oil into the pan, mix your veggies with the egg mixture and pour in a thin layer in the pan. Let the omelette cook at medium to low heat til the top is dry. Flip the omelette then place the chapati on top. Continue to cook for another minute then its ready.   
7. To assemble, make sure the omelette is facing up. Add one tomato sliced and 1/2 an avocado sliced. Wrap and enjoy.
