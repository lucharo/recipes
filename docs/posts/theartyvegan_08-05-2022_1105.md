👩🏽‍🍳PREPARATION:
✨CINABON DOUGH:
410g all-purpose flour
1 tsp salt
45g vegan butter
1 packet instant yeast
250ml fresh soya milk
15g brown sugar
✨Options for FILLING:
A) Keep it simple, like I did this time👆🏽- just sprinkle a nice amount of sugar and cinnamon powder all over, before you roll. 
B) Go fancy/ more indulgent: 
Melt 30g vegan butter with 30g brown sugar and 4tsp (to taste) ground cinnamon and smear all over before you roll
✨ GLAZE for BEFORE baking:
10g vegan butter melted, mixed with about 20ml of soya milk, beat thoroughly and brush all over rolls before putting in oven
✨ ICING (optional) for final touches 🤤
Sugar Glaze: icing powder mixed with water, start with 2 TBSP, and add a little bit of water but by bit,  beat, till no lumps and glaze is smooth, slightly thick texture. Pour all over once buns have cooled down from oven! 

⏲👩🏽‍🍳METHOD: 
(Pre-heat oven to 180c)
1) Prepare dough:
 Warm the milk 🥛and butter 🧈together till melted but not too hot or this will affect yeast. 2)Once not too hot, add the yeast and give it about 15 mins to activate. Add your sugar, and salt, and then slowly begin adding the flour bit by bit and start to knead. It’ll be sticky! 
3) Flour your surface and then transfer so you can add a bit more dough and knead 👊🏽. If you over knead it’ll become tough and more chewy once cooked so keep it light! 
4) Set in a covered bowl to rise for 50 mins ⏳or so, it should be quite a lot larger! 
5) Once it’s ready, flour your surface and roll it out till about 1/ 1.5cm thick. Now you can choose which filling you’ll go for and spread decently all over the up facing side. Once done, start to roll into a Swiss roll style shape. 
6) Cut 🔪into decent slices, try to keep them the same width so they cook evenly. And place in a baking tray with parchment paper. 
7) Brush with your glaze that’s been made for prior to oven baking, for nice golden touch!
8) Cover and leave to rise again for 15 mins. 
9) Then BAKE! 30mins should do it depending on your oven and how strong it is! Once out, let cool and then add icing glaze if you want! 
10) ENJOY! 🤤♥️
