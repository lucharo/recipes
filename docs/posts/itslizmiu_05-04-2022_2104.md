# ALFAJORES! 😋 A very delicious and popular sandwich cookie that hails from South America. Traditionally filled with dulce de leche (also called manjar or arequipe) and rolled in coconut but also very commonly found dipped in chocolate. Being made with cornstarch makes the cookies light, delicate and just an all-round delicious super melt-in-your-mouth situation. Today we’re keeping things easy by using @naturescharm Coconut Salted Caramel Sauce which is the perfect vegan dulce de leche 🙏🏼
