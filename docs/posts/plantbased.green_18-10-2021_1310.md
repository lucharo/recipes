Great for snacking or with a meal, it doesnâ€™t take much time to make these. \
\
Make ahead and store for later\
Freezer friendly\
\
Makes 12-16\
Cook time 30 minutes\
\
400g chickpeas, drained and rinsed \
200g couscous (sub for quinoa)\
1/2 red onion\
3 garlic cloves\
1 tsp paprika\
2 tsp parsley\
1 tbsp soy sauce or tamari \
Black pepper\
Salt\
\
Fire sauce\
4 tbsp hot sauce\
2 tbsp soy sauce or tamari\
2 tsp brown sugar\
1 tbsp cornstarch\
2 tbsp water\
\
Preheat oven to 200C/395F\
\
In a bowl add the couscous and cover with hot water. Place a tea towel and a plate over the bowl. Let the couscous stand for 5-10 minutes until soft and fluffy.\
\
In a food processor, add the chickpeas, red onion, garlic, seasonings, soy sauce and the cooked couscous. Pulse until combined, but be sure to not over pulse or the mixture will be mushy. \
\
Roll the chickpea mixture with your hands and place on a greased baking sheet, then bake for 30 minutes - turning halfway  through until lightly browned and crispy. \
\
Meanwhile, add the remaining ingredients to a frying pan on medium heat to make the fire sauce, stirring occasionally. Let it simmer for 5 minutes. \
\
Add the baked meatballs to the frying pan, coat everything evenly and garnish with coriander or chives. \
\
Enjoy!\
