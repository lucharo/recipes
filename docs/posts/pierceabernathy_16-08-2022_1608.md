# While traveling in Italy recently I ate Pappa al Pomodoro for the first time. It was life changing. Tuscan stale bread soup with only 8 Ingredients! ( thatâ€™s including salt, pepper, and olive oil). I truly have never had something so simple, so affordable and so delicious. This completely vegan dish has the texture and depth of Bolognese. Safe to say I am obsessed.
