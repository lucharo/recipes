This is my favorite risotto recipe, it’s creamy, rich, bursting with flavor, but at the same time fresh and light 🤤 the recipe is inspired by @sortedfood:  
⠀  
RECIPE (3 portions)  
For the sauce:  
- 2 red peppers  
- 3-4 medium tomatoes  
- 1 eggplant  
- 1 very small garlic bulb or 4 cloves  
- salt and pepper  
- 1-2 tbsp olive oil  
- 50g cashews (or vegan cream)  
- a splash of water, to blend  
⠀  
- 1-2 leeks  
- fresh thyme or herbs of choice  
- 300 g risotto rice  
- 250 ml white wine  
- vegetable broth, as needed  
- vegan parmesan (optional)  
⠀  
❶ Add peppers, tomatoes, eggplant and garlic to a baking tray. Sesaon with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Roast at 220°C for about 30 minutes.  
❷ In a pan sauté leek in a little bit of oil for 8-10 minutes, then add thyme and the risotto rice.   
❸ Deglaze the pan with white wine and gradually add in the broth, whenever needed.  
❹ When the veggies are done, blend with a handful of cashews and a splash of water until creamy.
