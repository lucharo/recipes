# (AD) Making some THERAPEUTIC CHOC-COVERED DATE CARAMELS to help me get my daily dose of medicinal mushrooms aaand B12! ✨ They’re so satisfying to make and I’ve thrown in my faaaave medicinal mushroom blend from the fabulous Aussie and female-owned @take_bioactives!! These choccies are so easy, yet… so LUXE?! Also I’m going to yelll about this MUSHROOM BLEND FOR A SEC. I’m honestly wild for it because it’s got the whole team, the whole quadfecta: reishi, chaga, cordyceps and lions mane. 😌 We’re talking energy support, less stress, immune support, brain health and a whole lot more but ON TOP OF THAT - ALL 8 B-vitamins jam-packed into it (biologically-availalble so you actually absorb that shhh), including old mate B12 which if you follow a plant based diet, you’ll know is super duper important to staying groovy 🕺🏻 Eat choccy and get the most out of your day!
