On a vegan streak this week with all the vegetables there are in my household so hereâ€™s one of my all time fave dishes made vegan! Basically just removed steak and replaced it with shiitake mushrooms.

The sauce combo is key - soy sauce, sesame oil & sugar. So simple but sooooo much flavour and umami. I may have eaten almost the entire pan because it was that good ðŸ˜›
