Ingredients
1.1 pound eggplant
1.5 tBsp tahini
1 tBsp olive oil
1/2 lemon
1 clove garlic
1/4 tsp salt
To Garnish:
1 tBsp pomegranate seeds
a few leaves of parsley
1 wholewheat pita bread 

Instructions
Prepare the eggplant by cooking it over a medium open flame until its soft, and you can pierce it easily with a skewer or knife. This usually takes around 4-5 minutes for each side and is the best way to obtain that delicious smoky flavor.

Leave the eggplant to cool completely, or cover with plastic wrap for 20-30 minutes and then remove the charred skin. It should come off easily. If there are a few stuck bits, use bits of tissue paper to help remove them - just don't rinse the aubergine underwater or you'll remove the smoky flavor and affect the texture.

Mash the eggplant flesh in a bowl, using a fork. You can also use a blender or food processor
 
Add salt, garlic, tahini, lemon juice, and mix well. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if necessary.

Finally, top the eggplant mixture with olive oil and sprinkle with parsley and pomegranate seeds. Enjoy along with Lebanese Pita bread!
