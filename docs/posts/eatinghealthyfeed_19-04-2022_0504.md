‚úÖ Macros for 1/4th of the Fries (you saw 1/2 of the fries in this bowl!):\
228 Cals, 49g Carbs, 2g Fat, 3g Protein!\
\
‚ú≥Ô∏è Ingredients:\
3 Medium Sweet Potatoes (about 275g each)\
40ml Vinegar\
Salt\
Garlic Powder\
Basil & Parsley\
Non Stick Butter or Olive Oil Spray\
\
‚ùáÔ∏è Directions:\
1Ô∏è‚É£ Preheat oven on 475 degrees F. Skin your sweet potatoes and then use your crinkle cutter to cut into fries. I got this one on Amazon!\
2Ô∏è‚É£ Now take a pot and add 6 cups of water, 40ml of vinegar and 6g salt.\
3Ô∏è‚É£ Bring pot to a boil and add half your sweet potatoes for 6 minutes.\
4Ô∏è‚É£ Now add 120ml of water and 75g of corn starch to bowl and mix.\
5Ô∏è‚É£ Line a large Pan with aluminum foil and spray with non stick cooking spray.\
6Ô∏è‚É£ Dunk your fries in the corn starch/water mixture and then add to pan. Leave space! Don‚Äôt crowd them on there üëåüèª\
7Ô∏è‚É£ Bake for 15 minutes and then flip. Bake for another 15 minutes.\
8Ô∏è‚É£ Once done, add to a bowl, add your seasonings of choice and toss the fries! Then it‚Äôs time to enjoy my friends!\

Tried these in the air fryer and they were not even close to as good as the oven!\
