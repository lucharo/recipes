1 cup Greek style soy yogurt  
1 cup soaked cashews   
2 tsp salt  
4-6 tbsp nutritional yeast  
2 tbsp tapioca starch  
1 tbsp agar  
1/2 cup water  
1 tsp miso paste  
2 tsp dijon mustard  
Juice of 1 lemon   
  
I actually made this recipe as a mozz you should use specifically in a caprese and not for melting 😅 so will experiment with a mozz-style sauce for better and meltier dairy-free pizza cheese! It doesn’t melt that good but if you’re not too fussed on texture, this does the job re: cheesy flavour on pizza
