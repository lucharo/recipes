# Bok Choy is one of my favorite vegetables and this Bok Choy with Garlic Sauce is inspired by the multitude of Chinese banquet restaurants my family and I would eat at together. The bok choy is crisp, tender and SO good with that savory garlic sauce. Itâ€™s a quick and easy side dish that pairs well with so many amazing dishes. I hope you enjoy!  #cjeatsrecipes
