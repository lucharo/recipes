# Chick’n & Plantain Waffles - a plant based-alternative made with enoki mushrooms! Another one of those mushrooms with all the texture and no strong mushroom flavors. It pretty much takes on any seasoning you pair it with. If you’ve not tried sandwiching some plantain in a waffle maker, you have to save this recipe and get on board 💛🙌🏾
