Using my very own sauce *currently sold out, stay tuned for more*  
  
Recommendations for using my sauce  
* coat mushrooms or vegetables or whatever you wanna cook in sauce, then place in an oven and roast until golden and brown. Add more sauce while cooking if needed.   
  
* for pan frying brown mushroom, vegetables or what ever you want to cook first, then brush on sauce   
  
* for dunking, dunk or drizzle on anything  
  
ðŸŒ± vegan mayo   
60ml aquafaba

Optional additions for flavour
