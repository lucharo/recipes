1️⃣ Nut Butter Chocolate Pots 🍫🤤 super easy, 6 ingredients and totally gluten-free & vegan!! Who would demolish these right now?! by @healthylivingjames\
\
🛒 Ingredients (makes 2)⁣\
\
▪️6 Tbsp oat flour (gluten-free oats)⁣\
▪️6 Tbsp cacao powder⁣\
▪️3 Tbsp maple syrup⁣\
▪️1 tsp baking powder⁣\
▪️Pinch salt⁣\
▪️130-140ml milk of choice (I used almond)⁣\
▪️2 tsp nut butter (1 in each ramekin)\
\
1️⃣ Firstly blend your oats into a flour (do about 1 cup or 100g so you have more oat flour for another day)\
2️⃣ To a mixing bowl add 6 tbsp of the oat flour + cacao powder + maple syrup + baking powder + salt + milk and mix (if it's a little thick depending on brand of milk add a little more)\
3️⃣ Now add a tsp of nut butter to each ramekin and pour in the chocolate sauce\
4️⃣ Bake at 200C (390F) for 10-12 minutes (quite dependent on how hot your oven runs for me it's 10 minutes)\
\
FAQ's\
\
➡️ Can I use other flour? I think something like almond, buckwheat and plain gluten free flour should work although I haven't tested them\
➡️ Can you microwave them? Yes, around 40-60 seconds should do it but again you will need to test this\
\
2️⃣ Peanut Butter Granola 🥰 Trust me this will beat any shop bought granola!! What's your favourite way to serve granola? by @healthylivingjames\
\
Ingredients (6 large servings):⁣⁣\
\
▪️ 2 cups oats, 200g (I use gluten-free)\
▪️ 1 cup almonds (150g)\
▪️ 1 cup walnuts (150g)\
▪️ 1 cup ground almonds (100g)\
▪️ 6 tbsp maple syrup\
▪️ 4 tbsp melted coconut oil\
▪️ 4 tbsp peanut butter (crunchy or smooth)\
\
1️⃣ To a large mixing bowl add all the ingredients above and mix\
2️⃣ Place on a baking tray and bake at 160C for 25 minutes until golden\
3️⃣ Remove from the oven and either eat warm or allow to cool\
\
FAQ'S:\
\
➡️ Not gluten-free? Just use normal oats\
➡️ Which oats are best? I think rolled oats are best as they are larger and better for granola\
➡️ What can I swap the maple syrup for? Try any liquid sweetener such as agave or even a runny honey should work\
➡️ What can I swap for the coconut oil? Try another oil\
➡️ Which peanut butter is best? Any works🙂\
➡️ Peanut allergy? Swap the peanut butter for almond
