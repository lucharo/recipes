# Vegan Sesame 'Chicken'üòãmade from king oyster mushrooms. This recipe is easy and fun to make. Using a meat tenderizer creates an amazing texture that absorbs the marinade so well with a great chew in each bite, similar to the rendang mushrooms (made from dried mushrooms stem) I got back at home. üëçüèº

Cooking notes:‚Å£  
- This recipe is very similar to my sesame tofu but uses a different batter. A simple mix of Kikkoman batter with ice-cold water to create a thick batter‚Å£  
- For homemade batter recipe, check my Korean 'fried' tofu.‚Å£  
- Please use white sesame seeds or raw so they don't burn easily‚Å£  
- Serve with rice or dip in sauce or check out my ginger chili sauce (10-minute recipe using red jalape√±o)‚Å£  
‚Å£  
I hope you give this a try and have a beautiful weekend. Best, WoonHeng ÈüµÈ¶®üíó‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
