Schnitzels are pretty unbeatable! So I wanted to recreate them with plants! Aubergine schnittys slap hard! Oh and this Thai salad on its own is insane!!   
  
Ingredients   
For the aubergine schnitzel  
1 aubergine   
2 tsp miso paste  
1 cup panko breadcrumbs   
Spray oil  
  
For the jalepeno drizzle:  
1 tbsp jappenos   
1 tbsp maple syrup  
Juice of 1 lime  
  
For the Thai salad:  
1 ripe mango  
1 red pepper   
Shredded carrot   
Shredded red and white cabbage   
2 spring onions  
1 bunch coriander   
1 cup peanuts   
For the dressing  
2 tbsp peanut butter   
1 tbsp maple syrup  
Juice of 1 lime   
Half a can coconut milk  
1 tbsp sriracha   
  
Method:  
1. Start by racking your aubergine under the grill at full temp. It should take 15 mins ish to start to blister and soften. Once it doesnâ€™t that wack it in a bowl and cover it to let it steam cook.  
2. Add all the prepped salad veggies into a bowl and mix together the Thai salad dressing. Combine the dressing with the salad and mix. Toast off some peanuts and add them into the salad too.  
3. Mix together your jalepenos, maple and lime in a jar and set aside.  
4. Once your aubergine is cooked, peel off the black skin so itâ€™s just flesh. Press down the flesh with a fork so youâ€™ve got a schnitzel shape. Brush on the miso paste and cover in panko breadcrumbs on both sides.   
5. Spray with oil and Add your aubergine to the oven for 10 mins until golden.  
6. Cook some rice, plate up your salad, then the aubergine schnitzel, top with the jalepeno honey drizzle and some sesame seeds and enjoy!
