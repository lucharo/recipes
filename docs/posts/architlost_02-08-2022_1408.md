# Not a recipe but a magic trick! This 2 ingredient chocolate mousse is so fascinating to make and I thinks it’s such a great way to showcase the beauty of a simple chocolate bar. Yes it kinda breaks rules of the kitchen as we know it but it actually works (unlike the 200 people who commented on my YouTube video about it 😂)
