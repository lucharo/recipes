To celebrate Pancake Day, I asked you in my stories which recipe youâ€™d prefer to see. It was a close call, but CRÃŠPES was the winner!\
\
Hope you enjoy making this!\
\
250g/2 cups AP flour (or gluten-free flour)\
530ml/ 2 1/4 cup oat milk\
30g/2 tbsp vegetable oil\
3 tbsp sugar\
2 tsp vanilla extract\
1 tsp cinnamon\
\
FAKE nutella:\
60g dark chocolate\
65g peanut butter or hazelnut butter\
\
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients until smooth and there are no flour clumps. \
\
To a non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat, pour the batter, then rotate it to spread the batter as thinly as possible. \
\
Cook for 2-3 minutes until slightly brown on one side and flip. Cook for another 1 minute.\
\
FAKE nutella:\
Warm dark chocolate and peanut butter, stir until smooth and creamy. \
\
Spread fake nutella and fold the crÃªpe, add your favourite toppings. \
