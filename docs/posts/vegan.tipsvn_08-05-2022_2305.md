Yummiest way to have a 🍌? Either way, these are DELICIOUS, gluten free, a healthier and fun pancake version 😍 They can even be stored to the day after in the fridge, just pop them into a bread toaster 👍🏽 tag someone who should try have their banana like this 🍌

Mini Banana Cakes  
  
- 1 banana  
- 30g vegan chocolate  
- Pancake batter (I used 1/2 cup oat flour + 1/2 cup plant milk + 1 tsp baking powder. Combine and let sit 10 minutes before dipping bananas)  
Cook on medium heat in a non stick pan, 2 minutes on each side
