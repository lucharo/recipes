Traditionally kimchi is made using fish sauce but to make sure it’s plant-based we are using @abakusfoods seaweed ‘sea salt’ crisps to help add that UMAMI FLAVOUR 🌊 

Grab some Abakus crisps as they make for a great snack, being super crunchy 😯 you can find them in Co-op, Asda, big Sainsburys + H&B. Stock-list 👉🏾 www.abakusfoods.com 👀
