# One of my most popular recipes! CREAMY MUSHROOM STROGANOFF! 😋 Things are getting a little chillier and this strog hits the spot on those cold nights! ⛄️If you don’t have a high powered blender, make sure you blend for long enough or the cashew cream won’t be smooth. Before I had my vitamix I used my ninja bullets and they did the job extremely well - I would blend for at least a whole minute.

-\
MUSHROOM STROGANOFF\
Cashew Cream\
1.5 cups roasted cashews, soaked in hot water then drained \
2 cups water\
2.5 tbsp beef stock powder\
1 tbsp dijon \
4 tbsp apple cider vinegar\
-\
Other\
3 tbsp vegan butter\
800g botton mushrooms\
2 brown onions\
1 tbsp minced garlic\
1 tsp dried thyme\
3 tbsp tomato paste\
1/2 cup red wine \
1 tsp black pepper \
1 cup water\
\
METHOD.\
Blend all cream ingredients until incredibly smooth. Chop mushrooms (or don’t! - I also like keeping small mushrooms whole for juicier bites), onion and garlic. Heat butter in a large pot and cook onion and garlic til soft. Add tomato paste, thyme and mushrooms and stir to coat all mushrooms until they’re red. Add wine and let mushrooms cook for a few minutes til soft, stirring regularly. Add cashew cream, pepper and water and cook down until stroganoff is a consistency you like. Serve with rice or pasta! \
