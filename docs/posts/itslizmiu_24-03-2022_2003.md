# Congee or Jook 粥 is just one of the best foods out there. It’s simple, easy to make, even easier to eat and just feels so nourishing for the soul 😌✨ In it’s most basic form it’s rice, water and salt but I do think ginger is a must. You pretty much just cook it down til it’s in a consistency you like and it’s pretty hard to screw up! I personally love to eat mine with preserved beancurd - it’s like an umami paste (and I buy one with chilli and sesame oil) and it’s just heavenly. I also like it with soy braised peanuts on top or some coriander 🙏🏼 #congee #recipes
