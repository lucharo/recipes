First of all, no-one would mistake this for real mozzarella, both taste and texture are not the same! But I’ve already tried a looot of different recipes for vegan mozzarella and this recipe has it all... It’s firm, it’s creamy, it tastes cheesy and yes, it melts! 😌 Perfect for caprese or on top of a pizza!\
⠀\
RECIPE (8 small balls)\
- 1 cup (150 g) cashews\
- 1 cup (250 g) unsweetened soy yogurt\
- 1-2 tsp salt\
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast (optional)\
- 3 tbsp tapioca starch\
- 1.5 tbsp agar agar powder\
- ½ cup (120 ml) water\
optional additions:\
- 1 tsp of miso paste\
- other herbs & spices\
⠀\
❶ Soak cashews overnight or boil for about 10 minutes.\
❷ Add cashews, vegan yogurt, salt, tapioca starch and nutritional yeast to a blender and blend until creamy. \
❸ In a pot combine the water and agar agar, stirring until the agar agar is completely dissolved. Bring it to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes.\
❹ Add the cashew cream to the saucepan and stir to combine. Cook the mixture for about 5-6 minutes, stirring constantly, until it gets very thick and stretchy.\
❺ Prepare a large bowl of ice-cold water. Scoop out mozzarella balls with 2 wet spoons. Let them cool to firm up.\
❻ You can place the balls in an airtight container and cover it with a salt brine to store them in the fridge for about a week.\

TIPS\
- you can replace the tapioca starch with cornstarch, but only tapioca provides that stretchy and melty consistency. \
