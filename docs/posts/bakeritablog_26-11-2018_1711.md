# I don‚Äôt know about you guys, but I need to reset with healthy food after this holiday weekend of feasting...this vegan RED LENTIL SOUP is a great place to start üôåüèª‚ú® will make you feel soo dang good, and it‚Äôs so incredibly delicious. It has a mostly smooth texture with a little bit of bite, and the tang of the lemon juice added at the end balances out the richness perfectly. Mop it up with some bread and you‚Äôre in heaven (@cocobakes sourdough is my fave to serve with this).
