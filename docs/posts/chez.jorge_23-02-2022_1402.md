# VEGGIE TOFU SOUP 青菜豆腐湯. 🥬 Complex dishes can entice, but I often find myself moved by some of the simplest. This one is a family favorite when we want something light, healthy, and warm to accompany the meal. A humble soup like this has a nourishing and heart-warming quality that you just can’t quite get tired of.

:) It’s been a while!\
\
THE RECIPE (for 2-4):\
2½ cups (600 mL) water, or use kombu dashi\
1 tsp salt, or to taste\
one block (400 g) tofu, medium-firm or soft\
three 1-inch slices (~5 g) peeled ginger\
50 g shimeji mushrooms\
100 g bok choy \
100 g wa-wa-cai, or use napa cabbage\
2 tsp dried wakame seaweed\
\
NOTES:\
1. Depending on the season, this soup can take on different flavors. Sometimes I add tomatoes, other times loofah. For tomatoes, add at the start and cook for the same duration; loofah doesn’t need long, add them towards the end. For a vegetarian version, you can also drizzle in a beaten egg at the end.\
\
2. Adding the tofu’s brine enhances tofu flavors in the soup, and gives it some good body. If you have kombu dashi on hand, you can use it in place of the water—it will enhance the umami flavor of the soup even more.
