This vegan Mayo is 100% foolproof, made in 5mins and tastes better than the store bought mayo.🤗
This was more sort of an experiment since I wanted to use that aquafaba but it was such a success! 🥳

👩‍🍳 You can use this mayo as base for many dips and sauces e.g stir in some sriracha and you’ll have sriracha Mayo (addict here haha).😁 

RECIPE (100g contain 485cal/1P/5C/51F):
-water of a can of chickpeas (about 1/2cup {125ml})
-1 Tbsp lemon juice
-1 Tsp mustard
-1 cup (250ml) neutral flavoured oil (important that it’s neutral flavoured)
FIRST blend chickpea water, lemon juice and mustard/GRADUALLY add the oil/AFTER 2-3mins it should have thickened/STORE in the fridge up to one week)
