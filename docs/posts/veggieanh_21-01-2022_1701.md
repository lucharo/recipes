To all my soy intolerant friends ðŸ¥° This is a soy-free alternative to tofu and can be used in any dishes like curries, salad or stir fry. Note that it can be more fragile and less sturdy than firm soy tofu.  
  
Another method to make chickpea tofu is to cook chickpea flour with water until thicken ðŸ˜Š  
  
Recipe:  
200g dry chickpeas, soak overnight (sub with 150g chickpea flour)  
500ml water
