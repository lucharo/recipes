First bake sweet potatoes in oven to whichever consistency you prefer.

Legumes such as beans or lentils can be boiled or stir fried with herbs and spices of preference.  
.  
For the guacamole mix three mashed avocados with half a chopped onion and 2 chopped tomatoes. Add salt and pepper to taste.  
.  
For cashew sour cream, blend cashews with either water or plant based milk in a 2:1 ratio (2 of cashews : 1 of liquid) and add a tablespoon of either lemon juice or vinegar for each 100g of cashews used.  
.  
And voila, baked sweet potatoes covered in beans/lentils, guacamole and cashew sour cream. Bon appÃ©tit! ðŸ¤¤
