# Portuguese Tomato Rice (Arroz de Tomate) 🍅 Inspired by recent travels to cook some Portuguese goodness this week! Missing the sun and the warmth 🥲 I adore tomato rice and when I found out Portugal had a version I had to try it and wow. So comforting, garlicky, satisfying and flavourful. It’s saucy and kinda like a tomato-ey porridge - I love it.
