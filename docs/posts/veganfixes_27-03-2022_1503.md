We usually make a little too much of this dish, so that the nect day we can take the leftovers and use it for a wrap 🤷🏼‍♀️ the outcome is AMAZING!
.
Ingredients:
- Tortilla wraps
- 200gr chickpea, cooked
- 200gr tofu, crumbled
- 200gr tomatoes, crushed
- 100ml coconut milk or cream
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 cm ginger, grated
- 1/2 onion, minced
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- salt and pepper
- 1 tsp paprika
.
1. In a pan, stir fry the onion, garlic and ginger with some oil until fragrant
2. Add tofu and spices and fry for 2 more minutes
3. Add tomatoes and let it simmer for some minutes
4. Add chickpeas and coconut cream and simmer for 10 minutes
5. You can mash some of the chickpeas with a fork if you like a thicker texture (for the wrap filling)
6. Build your wrap with the masala mix, some yogurt, pickled pink onion and coriander.
INCREDIBLE
