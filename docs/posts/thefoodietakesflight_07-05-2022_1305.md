Also hello to my fellow \#kakampinks 💗👋🏼

This one is for @bise_leni, the 14th Vice President of the Philippines and the only woman running for president this elections. She is an effective public servant who embodies strength, grace, and integrity.

She is hope for the Philippines that we may have a better leader with no taint of corruption and one that truly cares for the people, and hope for a more transparent government that we can trust and rely on—a government that each and every Filipino deserves.

We’re not only exercising our right to vote this May 9th, but we’re also voting for a better future for this country and all Filipinos. 🇵🇭

Happy weekend and please take & stay safe, everyone!! 💗
