# TEMPE KECAP! If you’ve never enjoyed tempeh before, it’s probably your own fault. Begin your apology tour with this GLORIOUSLY CRISPY recipe that you’ll often find served up as a part of Nasi Campur (Indonesian Mixed Rice) when eating in Bali. Oh, you could just come on our totally vegan foodie tour of Bali, instead.

This September 5 - 15th, join @itslizmiu and @zaccharybird on TEMPEH NATION CELEBRATION: 10 days of adventure, our favourite food finds, cooking classes, friends, fun and chilling in a private pool kinda vibes in beautiful Bali, Indonesia. You’re totally invited, so grab tickets from @thegetawayco now. TO MAKE THE DELICIOUS TEMPEH KECAP, you need:  
  
500g tempeh, cut into small tiny strips   
50g peanuts, crushed  
  
SPICE PASTE:  
2 shallots  
3 garlic cloves  
1 lemon grass stalk, white inner core only  
1 chunk ginger or galangal  
-  
4 makrut lime leaves  
1 red chilli sliced  
-  
3 tbsp kecap manis  
1 tbsp chopped palm sugar, to taste  
Few tbsp water  
1/2 tsp salt  
  
Deep fry tempeh in batches until CRIBBSY (about 5 mins per batch). Blend the spice paste. Switch out some fresh oil into the pan, then fry off the paste. Add the lime leaves, then chilli. Toss through the tempeh and sauce and fry until coated and sticky. Serve alongside rice, urap sayur (recipe coming next week!), satay and sambal to get a lil taste of what’s in store in Bali later this year!
