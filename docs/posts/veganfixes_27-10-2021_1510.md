# Eggplants are one of the vegetables I saw in a much different light and started to appreciate a lot more every since I went vegan because they’re so versatile and different prep & cooking methods yield different textures and results🍆 by @thefoodietakesflight

For these Miso Sesame Eggplants, I used American eggplants that are smaller and plumper than the Chinese variety so I sliced hese in a criss-cross pattern to make sure they’re cooked through. This also makes sure the sauce really seeps in during baking! 👀🍆  
  
The sauce is packed full of umami with a hint of sweetness and a kick of spice 🌶 this recipe requires very minimal prep time since you can just let the oven do its thing!!   
  
I also really like my eggplants extra silky so I really cooked them down well, but of course it’s up to you how cooked through you want yours to be 👌🏻
