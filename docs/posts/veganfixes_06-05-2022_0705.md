\
Here's how to make the recipe\
(Makes 5-6 meatless meatballs)\
\
260g meatless meat (choose your favourite brand)\
400g passata\
3 garlic cloves, minced\
1 red chili\
1/4 red onion, diced\
1 bunch of curly parsley, stems chopped\
50g panko breadcrumbs\
4 tbsp nutritional yeast\
1 tbsp soy sauce or tamari\
1 tsp dried oregano\
1/2 tsp black pepper\
\
Herby Garlic Bread\
French baguette, sliced diagonally\
3 tbsp plant-based butter\
2 garlic cloves, grated\
1 tbsp curly parsley, chopped\
Salt\
Black pepper \
\
Add 2 tbsp of oil to a frying pan over medium heat. Once warm, form meatballs with the mixture and add to the frying pan. Cook for 10-12 minutes, occasionally rotating and cooking evenly until golden brown and lightly charred. \
\
Reduce heat to low and add the passata to the frying pan. Warm the sauce for a few minutes before serving. \
\
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180C/360F. \
\
In a mixing bowl, add plant-based butter, garlic, curly parsley, salt and black pepper, combine. Spread the herby and garlic butter evenly onto some bread and bake in the oven for 5-8 minutes until the butter has melted and the bread starts to brown.\
\
Serve the meatless meatballs with your favourite pasta or have it as it is. Enjoy!\
