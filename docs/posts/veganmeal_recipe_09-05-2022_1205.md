Frozen Snickers Banana Pops 🍌🍫 (Vegan & Gluten Free)

Name a better combo than chocolate + peanut butter + banana, I dare you. All my favourite things on one popsicle stick, my life is complete.

These are so easy and quick to make, and 100% satisfy a sweet tooth!!

INGREDIENTS -
2 bananas
Peanut butter (I used crunchy salted caramel @eatfatso )
Peanuts
Approx 1/4-1/3 cup chocolate chips (can use vegan chocolate chips like @enjoylifefoods if desired)
1 tsp coconut oil

DIRECTIONS -
1) Line a baking tray or plate with parchment paper and set aside.
2) Cut ends of bananas off, then cut them in half. Stick popsicle stick in the middle of bananas, then freeze for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
3) Remove from freezer and coat bananas with peanut butter. Then roll into the peanuts.
4) In a microwave safe bowl, heat the chocolate chips and coconut until fully melted.
5) Using a spoon, coat the bananas with chocolate shell. Put back in freezer for 10 minutes till set. Enjoy!
