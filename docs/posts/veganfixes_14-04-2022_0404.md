\
Serves 2 (double quantities to serve 4)\
For the tofu:\
280g extra firm tofu, pressed for 10 minutes \
1 tbsp olive oil\
2 tbsp cornstarch\
\
For the sauce\
3 tbsp vegan ghee or butter\
1 large onion, diced\
1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated\
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced\
8-10 curry leaves\
1 tbsp garam masala\
1 tbsp ground coriander\
1 tbsp cumin seeds, toasted\
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper\
1 tsp salt\
4 tbsp  tomato paste\
400g full fat coconut milk\
\
Wrap the tofu with a clean tea towel or paper towel and stack something heavy like books/sauce pot to press the liquid from the tofu. Press for 10 minutes.\
\
Preheat the oven to 200C/392F.\
\
Tear the tofu into smaller pieces, place in a mixing bowl and mix the olive oil and cornstarch until everything is coated evenly. Place the tofu on the baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes.\
\
While the tofu bakes, make the creamy sauce.\
\
Melt the ghee then add the onions, garlic and ginger and sauté for 5 minutes. Add the remaining spices, tomato paste and coconut milk. Stir until combined, then simmer for 10 minutes.\
\
When the tofu’s finished baking, add it to the sauce and stir to coat everything. Serve with rice, toasted coconut flakes and fresh coriander. Enjoy!\
