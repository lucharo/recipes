This pollo a la brasa inspired marinade takes queues from the classic Peruvian dish. 🇵🇪 Full of citrus notes from lime, warming spices like cayenne and cumin, and the perfect amount of saltiness from soy sauce.\
\
This dish, and marinade, is the perfect example of how beautifully cultures can merge, bringing with it new and innovative meals, traditions, and community. The Chinese/Japanese influence is seen throughout Peru, from Arroz Chaufa (a peruvian fried rice)🍛, to ceviche and its preparation techniques 🐟, to this marinade with its use of soy sauce.\
\
✨Here’s how to make it ✨\
- Juice of 2 limes\
- zest of 1 lime\
- 2 tbsp olive oil\
- 1 tbsp miso paste\
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce\
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard\
- 1 tbsp maple syrup\
- 1 garlic clove, minced\
- 1/2 tsp cayenne\
- 1 tsp ground cumin\
- salt, to taste\
\

2. Peel apart your oyster mushrooms into chicken nugget bite pieces. Marinate them in a bowl for about 5 to 10 minutes.\
3. Heat 2 tbsp high smoke point oil (like avocado oil) in a cast iron skillet over medium heat\
