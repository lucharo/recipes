# ADDICTIVELY SPICY CUCUMBERS 🥒 This fancy snack by @mila_the_vegan.2 is both healthy AND delicious! Each savory bite is full of important electrolytes that can help prevent dehydration and maintain optimal digestion. Plus, cucumbers are also rich in substances that may help lower blood sugar and regulate insulin release, and they contain a variety of vitamins and minerals as well. If you're trying to add more veggies to your life, we highly recommend this recipe!⁠
