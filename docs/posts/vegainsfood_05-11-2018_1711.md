-
400g cooked or canned salt-free chickpeas (don’t use chickpeas with salt it will taste gross 😝)
2 tablespoons nut butter (we used cashew butter)
a splash of plant milk
2-3 tablespoons cacao powder
vanilla flavor or extract
5 pitted dates
-
Throw everything in a food processor and blend until smooth. Add some chocolate chips if you want and you are ready to go! I loved to dip in apple slices but feel free to use whatever 😋
-
Most of the staples I used here I get from KoRo. Watch my highlight story “KoRo” to learn more and use my 5% code VEGAINS5 for their great whole food staples in high quality and for an affordable price 👌🏼 \#anzeige
