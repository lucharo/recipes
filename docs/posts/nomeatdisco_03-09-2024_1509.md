Sometimes you want something quick and delicious and that doesnâ€™t take any time at all and itâ€™s this!   
  
Ingredients   
For the tofu ricotta:  
Half block silken tofu  
Quarter block firm tofu  
1 tsp garlic powder  
Juice of half a lemon  
1/2 cup nutritional yeast   
2 tbsp blitz cashews (optional)  
1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley   
Smoked salt   
Pepper   
  
Filo pastry   
Chilli jam (I used @russelluppickleco )  
Hot maple syrup  
Sesame seeds   
Spring onions  
  
Method:  
1. Start by whisking the silken tofu, add the lemon juice, firm tofu salt and pepper and mix again.  
2. Now add the nooch and parsley and mix once more.  
3. Lay out 2 filo sheets, spoon on some chilli jam in the centre and then top with the tofu ricotta. Butter the edges and then fold in each of the corners to create a parcel shape.   
4. Cover it in one more filo sheet to make sure itâ€™s sealed and then butter the outside. Add to the oven at 180C for 15/20 mins or until golden.   
5. Top with hot maple syrup or any topping you like.
