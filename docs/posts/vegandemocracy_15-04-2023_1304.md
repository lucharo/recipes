SUPER CRISPY SMASHED POTATOES  
Ingredients  
1 kg of small potatoes, washed  
3 tbsp oil  
Generous pinch of salt  
  
To serve:  
Chopped parsley to garnish  
Sriracha mayo or dipping sauce of choice  
  
Method  
1. Preheat oven to 200C/390F.   
2. Prick potatoes with a fork. Boil the potatoes for about 20 minutes in salted water until soft and a fork can easily pierce them.  
3. Drain the potatoes and transfer to a baking tray. Press the potatoes down using the bottom of a glass or a potato masher to flatten them. The skin will break open. Press them so they are flattened but not breaking apart, about 2.5-3cm / 1 inch thick.  
4. Drizzle over the olive oil and salt.  
5. Bake for 30 minutes, then check colour. Depending on your oven, to get them SUPER crispy they may need another 10 - 20 minutes. Keep checking on them every 10 minutes until they are golden and starting to brown around the edges.  
6. Serve immediately with dipping sauce of choice, garnish with parsley.
