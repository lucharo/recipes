Cooking notes:‚Å£
- Place the dried aromatics into the bowl first (hot oil may overcook these) so they don't turn bitter‚Å£
- I used two types of chili flakes for texture and spice level‚Å£
- Used oil that can withstand high heat. If you prefer more oil than chili flakes, please adjust the amount accordingly.‚Å£
- Make a flavored oil if you like - add bay leaf, star anise, or cinnamon‚Å£
‚Å£
I hope you give this easy chili oil a try. Have a beautiful weekend!
