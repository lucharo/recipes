This is the FOURTH recipe of our five-part mango series, and Iâ€™m super excited to share this one with you all! ðŸ¥­ \
\
The tart and floral taste of the mango complements perfectly with the sweetness of the coconut sauce, making this dessert absolutely irresistible!\
\
I know I say everything is my favorite, but mango sticky rice holds a special place since many desserts and snacks made from rice are super common in SE asian cuisine that I grew up on.â€¨â€¨The recipe + different sticky rice cooking methods is up on the blog now :)\
