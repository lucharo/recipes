Recipe:
Raspberry Chia Jam:
- 2 Cups Frozen Raspberries

- 2 Tbsp Rice Malt Syrup
- 2 Tbsp Hot Water

Choc Tart Shell:
- 1 & 1/2 Cups Roasted Almonds
- 1 & 1/2 Cups Oats

- 1 Tsp Vanilla
- Pinch of Salt

Garnish:
- 5-10g Melted Vegan Dark Choc

1. Place all jam ingredients into a bowl and mash until smooth. Be patient with it, the raspberries with eventually melt and become jam-like. 
2. Place all tart shell ingredients into a food processor and process until smooth. Push into to a 6-hole silicon tray and use your hands to create a well in each. 
3. Fill with the raspberry jam and set in the freezer for 30 minutes. Garnish with chocolate and set in the freezer for 5 minutes. Enjoy!
