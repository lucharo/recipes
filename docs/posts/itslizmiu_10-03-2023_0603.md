This trending toast was made popular by a Korean-Chinese celebrity chef Lee Yeon Bok and I just had to make a plant-based version! SO crunchy and delicious. If you can’t find vegan prawns, try making it with tofu! Find the full recipe on my Whisk profile (where you can also find the classic Chinese takeaway sesame prawn toast version too!)
