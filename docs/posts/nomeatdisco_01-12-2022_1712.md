2 Tbsp maple syrup\
1 Tbsp soy sauce \

For the butter bean purée: \
1 can butter beans\
3 cups frozen peas\
1 Tbsp whole grain mustard\
1 Tbsp vegan butter\
1 Onion\
3 Cloves garlic\
\
Method:\
1. Start by mixing the marinade ingredients in a jar and bathing the parsnips in the marinade and adding them to an oven at 190C for 40 mins.\
2. Whilst they’re cooking, fry off the onions and garlic in half the butter.\
3. Add the whole grain mustard and peas and butter beans and cook for 5 mins.\
4. Add to a blender and blitz until it forms a purée.\
