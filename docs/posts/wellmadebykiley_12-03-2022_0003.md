Foolproof plans for a very good Friday night. There are no words. Just make it this weekend, trust me. 

A simple recipe that‚Äôs fudgy, gooey, and literally bursting with chocolate - just the way I like it ü§ç

Also - if you haven‚Äôt tried putting @oat.haus granola butter in your baked sweets, this is your sign to DO it ü•∞ Sweet granola + chocolate, a combination made in heaven ‚òÅÔ∏è

\#Recipe Details:
Ingredients:
- 3 tbsp oat flour (gf if needed) @bobsredmill 
- 2 tbsp coconut sugar
- 2 tbsp cocoa powder @mrm_nutrition 
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- Pinch of salt
- 5 tbsp almond milk
Filling:
- 2 squares of chocolate (I used @lilys_sweets dark chocolate)
- 1 tbsp nut butter or granola butter (I used @oat.haus vanilla granola butter)

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 390 degrees F. Spray a ramekin or small oven-safe bowl with nonstick cooking spray, set aside.
In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients for the lava cake batter.
Pour 2/3 of the of the batter into the prepared ramekin or bowl. 
Place the chocolate in the middle of the batter, followed by dolloping the nut butter or granola butter on top of the chocolate.
Pour the remaining batter on top of the chocolate and nut butter to completely cover it.
Bake for 10-11 minutes.
Top with powdered sugar (@sweetleafstevia).
Enjoy!
