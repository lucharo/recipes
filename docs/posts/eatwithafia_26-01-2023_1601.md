It’s interesting to see the close cultural connection between Ivory Coast and Ghana as we share a major ethnic group  
  
Ivorian foufou is basically Ghanaian eto’s cousin but eaten a little different.  
  
There are so many renditions of this recipe on YouTube! For mine, I boiled two plantains that had just turned yellow without salt for about 10-15 mins till the were tender when I poked a fork through. I thin mashed it in my earthernware. You don’t need to let it cool down. I have also made this in my food processor and it works perfectly. For a bigger batch, a stand mixer is really good too. Add in some palm oil. I added a few tbsp of red palm oil. This is required. Mash till it’s smooth. Serve with soup of choice. This goes really well with the sauce gnangnan I have on my blog or even the palm nut soup
