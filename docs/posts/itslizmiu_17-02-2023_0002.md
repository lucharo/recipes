# MANGO SAGO 🥭 the perfect summer dessert! It’s refreshing, cold and not too sweet and really easy to make with only 5 ingredients. If you’re feeling extra, chill your serving bowls/cups 😎 Make sure to use a quality coconut milk, something like @chefschoicefoods - the ingredients are literally just coconut and water and the flavour is too good 🤌🏼 @naturescharm dairy-free sweetened condensed milks are GAME-CHANGING and they have coconut and oat. Highly recommend!
