Full recipe on www.thefoodietakesflight.com - link in bio @thefoodietakesflight ‚ú®  
  
Thin strips of extra firm tofu cooked down in a savory, sweet, garlicky, and peppery sauce. I used a peeler to get thin strips of extra firm tofu that I air-fry to draw out any excess moisture and cook down in the sauce to soak up all the flavors.  
  
You can also add vegetables to the stir-fry and serve this over a bowl of steamed üçö
