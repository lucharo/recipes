# Roti Pisang (Banana) with sweet caramelized banana on the inside with a crispy crunch on the outside is one of the sweet versions of roti canai. We get this often at Mamak stalls - my teenager hangs out place. It's like Starbucks here but with no air-conditioning.üòÑ Most roti canai is vegetarian but not vegan friendly. This roti pisang is! If you like banana, I hope you give this delicious roti a try too. Don't forget a cup of teh tarik (pulled tea) to go with itüòã‚Å£
