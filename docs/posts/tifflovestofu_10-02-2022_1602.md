You might be familiar with Lao Gan Ma but have you tried sate sauce? Itâ€™s a mix between a chili sauce and chili oil. â€¨\
Composed of lemongrass, shallots, garlic, bird eye chili pepper, and a few other spices, this is the key to adding flavor and a little bit of heat to any meal. Make a large batch and gift it to your friends, family, and loved ones. Theyâ€™ll thank you for it. ðŸ˜‡\
