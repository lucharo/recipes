1️⃣ HOMEMADE COOKIE BUTTER 😋  
  
This is the perfect last minute Xmas gift or a nice presents for a foodie-friend. 😉  
You basically use any cookies you like, I used speculoos (many brands make it vegan), so it tastes like biscoff spread. 😮‍💨  
  
RECIPE (4 small jars, 20min prep time):  
-450g cookies (I recommend speculoos)  
Blend until it’s a fine powder  
-5 Tbsp almond butter   
-2/3 cup (160ml) plant milk  
Blend again until smooth.  
It’ll last in the fridge up to 2weeks.  
  
2️⃣ EASY VEGAN CRÊPES 🥞   
  
I love Crêpes and this is my easy, foolproof recipe for having perfectly soft Crêpes everytime. 😋  
You can fill them with a chocolate spread, cinnamon sugar or anything else you like. 🙌  
  
RECIPE (6-8 Crêpes, 20min prep time):  
-1 cup (125g) flour  
-1 Tbsp corn starch  
-1 Tbsp sugar   
-1 1/3 cup (325ml) plant milk  
Mix together until it’s a smooth batter.  
Spread in a non stick pan a thin layer of the batter.  
Fry each side for just 1min until golden brown.  
Enjoy warm.
