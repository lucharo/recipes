I saw @madebyblitz and @phitzee create this dish recently and also saw @chez.jorge cook something similar live w/ blitzy 👀 all talented people that create some amazing food and content, go check them all out! 👏🏾 \
\
This one is super easy and you’ll be rewarded with the most crispy, sticky, tangy tofu you’ve ever had 😋 the gochujang paste really makes this dish and can be substituted with chilli paste but it won’t be the levels this bowl full was 👀 \
\
What other crispy tofu combos are out there? I’m a sucker for that crispy goodness and wanna make more this week!\

⭐️ INGREDIENTS ⭐️ \
\
-1 block of firm tofu (pressed and dried)\
-4 tbsp corn flour\
-2 garlic cloves minced\
-1/2 inch ginger minced\
-1 red chilli sliced\
-3 tbsp light soy sauce\
-1 tsp rice vinegar\
-1 tsp tomato paste\
-1 tbsp gochujang paste/chilli paste\
-sesame seeds and spring onion to garnish \
\
⭐️ METHOD ⭐️ \
\
-cut or break your tofu into small inch sized pieces and then cover in corn flour (I place mine in a sealable container and shake) then fry in hot oil until all sides are crispy then set aside.\
-fry your chilli, garlic and ginger for a few minutes before adding soy sauce, rice vinegar, tomato paste and gochujang paste along with a splash of water and combine into a sticky sauce, heating for a few minutes stirring constantly.\
-add in the crispy tofu and then toss until it is completely coated in the sauce, top with sesame seeds and spring onion and then serve with rice. \
