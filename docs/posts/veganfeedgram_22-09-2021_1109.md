1️⃣ SEARED NAPA CABBAGE with miso butter🔥 by @chez.jorge Suitable decadence for the humble vegetable, I’d say. Searing cabbage like a steak not only gives you incredible charred notes, but the intense heat locks up all those juices, keeping each leaf juicy & crunchy. It’s so good.   
  
Flavor aside, can we just appreciate how the cabbage looks just like a flower?! Nature is so beautiful. Boys, it’s your calling to use this dish and impress a special someone.😏   
  
THE RECIPE (for 4):  
1 large (700 g) napa cabbage  
vegetable oil, for searing  
4 tablespoons vegan butter  
3 cloves garlic, finely minced  
3 tablespoons light-brown miso  
4 tablespoons mirin (or sake)  
2 teaspoons tamari soy sauce  
1/3 cup water  
1 sheet toasted nori, for topping  
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, for topping  
1 scallion, for topping   
  
🌱 Lots of ways you can change up the flavor using a different sauce! Umami, citrusy, & spicy flavors all go great with seared cabbage.   
  
2️⃣ SMASHED BRUSSELS SPROUTS with garlic chili oil 🌶 by @chez.jorge Finally a dish where the humble brussels sprout takes center stage: these are smashed and roasted just like potatoes to achieve a crispy exterior and ultra tender interior. The fragrance of garlic & chili provides an almost floral contrast, evident in every bite. A true convert!!   
  
THE RECIPE:  
400 grams (35-40) fresh brussels sprouts  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
—————————  
1/4 cup vegetable oil  
12 cloves garlic, finely minced  
2 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean red chili powder)  
salt, to taste
