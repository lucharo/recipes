A dish that celebrates Chinese influences on Japanese ramen, in the most delectable way. It is a Japanese rendition of dan dan noodles but not like the original Sichuan version, and more like the soupy Hong Kong version. Its broth is timid on spice but no less complex; boldly umami, drunk on sesame and chili, yet attentive to the subtle notes of tang and sweet. Clinging to those springy alkaline noodles are bits of miso mince topping, which are so meaty they might send you into an existential trance. Indeed, who am I without a bowl of spicy noodles?\
\
THE RECIPE (for 2)\
Broth:\
2 cups (480 g) water\
6 (25 g) dried shiitake mushrooms\
1 large piece (15 g) kombu\
1¼ cup (300 g) barista oat milk\
\
Scallion oil:\
¾ cup (170 g) vegetable oil\
4-5 (100 g) scallions, chopped\
2 inch ginger, roughly chopped\
\
Nikumiso:\
2 Tbsp scallion oil, for frying\
½ block (200 g) firm or extra-firm tofu\
2 cloves garlic, minced\
1 inch ginger, minced\
1 scallion, minced\
2 Tbsp dark-brown miso\
1 Tbsp soy sauce\
2 Tbsp mirin\
1 tsp sugar\
\
Each bowl:\
1½ Tbsp sesame paste\
1 Tbsp chili oil\
1 tsp scallion oil\
½ tsp toasted sesame oil\
1½ Tbsp soy sauce\
½ tsp rice vinegar\
1 Tbsp zha cai, minced\
1½ cup (360 g) broth\
1 portion (200 g) ramen noodles\
1 head bok choy, blanched\
\
NOTES\
1. I love using barista-grade oat milk for vegan ramen because it makes an exceptionally creamy broth, comparable to tonkotsu or paitan. It almost feels like cheating. If you don’t have access, soy milk will be your next best option.\
\
2. Opt for homemade chili oil. You can make a big jar ahead of time. I used the one I’ve previously shared—you can go a little heavier on sichuan (or sansho) pepper to give it that signature tingly fragrance.\
