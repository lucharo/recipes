Serves 2 (double quantities to serve 4)
For the tofu:
280g extra firm tofu, pressed for 10 minutes 
1 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp cornstarch

For the sauce
3 tbsp vegan ghee or butter
1 large onion, diced
1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
8-10 curry leaves
1 tbsp garam masala
1 tbsp ground coriander
1 tbsp cumin seeds, toasted
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp salt
4 tbsp  tomato paste
400g full fat coconut milk

Wrap the tofu with a clean tea towel or paper towel and stack something heavy like books/sauce pot to press the liquid from the tofu. Press for 10 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 200C/392F.

Tear the tofu into smaller pieces, place in a mixing bowl and mix the olive oil and cornstarch until everything is coated evenly. Place the tofu on the baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes.

While the tofu bakes, make the creamy sauce.

Melt the ghee then add the onions, garlic and ginger and sauté for 5 minutes. Add the remaining spices, tomato paste and coconut milk. Stir until combined, then simmer for 10 minutes.

When the tofu’s finished baking, add it to the sauce and stir to coat everything. Serve with rice, toasted coconut flakes and fresh coriander. Enjoy!
