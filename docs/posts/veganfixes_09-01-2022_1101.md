You asked for sweet and spicy - you get sweet and spicy!   
  
💥Here’s my No Waste Sweet & Spicy Cauliflower (don’t forget to eat the leaves too)!   
  
Sweet & Spicy Sauce:  
150g soy sauce  
80g maple syrup  
2 tbsp sesame seeds  
1 tbsp rice vinegar  
2 tbsp tomato paste  
2 tsp chili sauce  
1 thumb-size piece of ginger  
2 tbsp sesame seeds   
  
Cauliflower:  
130g flour  
200g water  
1 tbsp sesame seeds   
  
Preheat oven to 200c   
  
Coat the cauliflower in the flour, water and sesame seeds and bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes.   
  
Next, make the sauce and bring to a boil on medium heat. Simmer for 5 minutes or until the sauce has reduced.   
  
Coat the cauliflower and leaves in the sauce and bake for another 15-20 minutes.   
  
Enjoy!
