3 aubergines
salt + pepper
1 tbsp tahini
3 tbsp lemon juice
olive oil
2 garlic cloves, peeled + finely chopped
small handful of fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped
handful of pomegranate seeds
 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Place the aubergines on a baking tray and grill for 35-45 minutes until charred, turning once halfway through. Then leave to cool.
 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Next trim the tops and remove the skins from the aubergines. Transfer the flesh to a sieve resting over a bowl, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and use a fork to mash the aubergine, pushing out as much water as possible.
 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Transfer the aubergine, tahini, lemon juice, 2 tbsp of olive oil, garlic and large pinches of salt and pepper to a bowl and combine with a fork.
 
4Ô∏è‚É£ Finish with a splash of olive oil, a small pinch of salt, the parsley and pomegranate seeds.
