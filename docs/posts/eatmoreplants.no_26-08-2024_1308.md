Ingredients (3 jars)  
3 tbsp miso paste (I prefer white miso paste)  
3 tbsp soy sauce  
3 tsp sriracha  
1.5 cups shelled edamame  
1 carrot shredded  
0.5 red pepper thinly sliced  
1 sheet nori seaweed  
1 cup red cabbage thinly sliced  
1/2 cup chopped cilantro or other fresh herbs of choice  
3 tsp vegetable bouillon powder  
3 portion sized noodles of choice  
  
Instructions:  
1. Add 1 tbsp each miso paste, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sriracha and 1 tsp vegetable bouillon powder to the bottom of each container.  
2. Now divide the chopped and shredded veggies/herbs between the containers.   
3. Top with the noodle nests.   
4. Store in the fridge for up to 5 days. When ready to serve, add boiling water overtop, filling almost to the top of the jar and let sit for 5 minutes.  
5. Stir everything together, then pour into a bowl and serve and enjoy.
