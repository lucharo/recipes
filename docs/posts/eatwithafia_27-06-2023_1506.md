Tamarind is an indigenous fruit to the continent of Africa but now widely used in African, Asian and Caribbean cooking. It can be tart with a hint of sweetness which makes it a great addition to drinks   
  
This drink is simple, it last a long time in the fridge, refreshing and also healthy fo you. Each ingredients is a powerhouse on its own with the tamarind and ginger combo alone setting you up for success. There is no Ghanaian drink without some indigenous spices, which add dimension but also flavour. The full recipe is on my blog :)
