INGREDIENTS  
600g firm tofu  
Oil, for frying  
  
COATING  
1/3 cup cornstarch  
1/2 tsp white pepper  
1/2 tsp salt   
  
TERIYAKI SAUCE  
1/4 cup soy saucee  
2 tbsp mirin  
1 tbsp brown sugar  
1 tbsp apple syrup (or other sweetener)  
1 tbsp minced ginger  
2 cloves minced garlic  
-  
1/2 tbsp cornstarch + 1 tbsp water  
  
TO SERVE  
1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds  
Spring onions, sliced  
Hot jasmine rice  
  
METHOD  
Begin by draining and patting tofu dry. Cut into chunky pieces.  In a small jug or bowl whisk together the soy sauce, mirin, brown sugar, apple syrup, minced ginger and garlic. In a large mixing bowl mix together the cornstarch coating. Heat up enough oil to cover the base of your frypan. As the oil is heating, generously toss your tofu in the cornstarch mix to coat. Make sure oil is hot before you begin frying. Fry the tofu for a few minutes, flipping on each side so they become crispy all over then drain on some paper towel and set aside. Empty your pan of any excess oil and wipe down with some paper towel. Return pan to low heat and add your teriyaki sauce. In a small bowl mix dissolve cornstarch and water and add to the sauce, mixing until your sauce begins to thicken. Turn off the heat and add your tofu, tossing to coat in the sauce. Sprinkle with toasted sesame and garnish with spring onions. Serve with hot jasmine rice!  
  
NOTES  
*AIR-FRYING: Coat tofu in cornstarch mix. Spray your air-fryer base in a layer of oil and arrange tofu in a single layer making sure no pieces are touching. Give tofu a good spray of oil on all sides as unsprayed sections will end up in powdery mouthfeels when eating. Airfry for 8 mins at 200¬∫C, flip and spray, and airfare for another 8 minutes. Finish in a pan with by heating the sauce as per above instructions.  
**MORE SAUCY: simply double the sauce measurements for extra sauce!
