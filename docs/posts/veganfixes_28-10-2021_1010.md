Now you’ll never throw away cauliflower leaves again! \#nowaste   
  
Serves:  
4 as a side, 2 as a mains  
  
1 large cauliflower, remove florets, leaves and core  
1-2 tbsp olive oil  
2-3 tbsp cornflour or cornstarch  
Salt  
Black pepper  
  
Tahini Mustard Lemon Sauce:  
1 tbsp tahini  
2 tsp dijon mustard  
1/4 lemon, juice  
1 tsp maple syrup  
  
Preheat oven at 200C or 390F  
  
Add the cauliflower, leaves and the core to a large mixing bowl. Pour the olive oil and mix. Next, add the cornflour, salt and black pepper and mix again.   
  
Spread on a baking sheet evenly and bake for 15-20 minutes until the cauliflower is cooked and the edges begin to brown.  
  
Meanwhile, to make the sauce, add all the ingredients to a empty jam jar or bowl, shake or whisk until smooth.  
  
Add the baked cauliflower and leaves to a bowl, drizzle the tahini mustard lemon sauce and mix well.   
  
To serve, add cauliflower to a plate or bowl, sprinkle a bit of sesame seeds and chives.   
  
You can have this by itself, next to any dish or incorporated into tacos, pasta and rice dishes.  
  
Enjoy!
