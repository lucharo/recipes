And what better food to start with than tofu?  </p> <p>Usually made with soybeans, tofu originated in China and is widely used in many traditional dishes or often as a protein replacer of meat/fish. Soybeans have an incredibly high protein content, which make them the perfect legume for tofu. But you can also extract the protein and bind it into a soft block from other protein-rich legumes, like chickpeas. The methods vary slightly, as with traditional tofu you\u2019d introduce acidity, which, similar to cheese, makes the liquid curdle, giving you the chance to strain and press It into a firm block. With chickpeas, the protein helps to set the tofu into a soft gelatinous block, also known as Burmese tofu.  </p> <p>I used locally grown @hodmedods\u2019 chickpeas, harvested from the Breckland soils of Norfolk, to turn this into a British tofu. No air miles, and using a crop that\u2019s grown in the UK only since 2019! This is what plant-based food should be about in the future. Learning from other cultures, then applying it to what\u2019s available around us.  </p> <p>Full recipe on my website www.ontheshelf.uk  </p> <p>#tofu #burmesetofu #chickpeatofu #localkitchen #cookingathome   </p>"},{"location":"posts/bakinghermann_15-04-2022_1004/","title":"A vegan Saag Paneer, with a handful of wild garlic - my favourite way to use up the abundance of fresh spinach that spring brings along.","text":"<p>recipe by @bakinghermann  (Julius Fiedler) - see original post</p> <p></p> <p>Saag is an Indian word for leafy green vegetables, but also commonly used for spinach or the spiced spinach dish made with it.

I encourage you guys to try this bread recipe as it is very simple easy going dough to make and super forgiving in shaping.  </p> <p>YASSS!  </p> <p>We are all BREAD!  </p> <p>#armenia #armenian #armenianbread #bread #baking #fromscratch #bakingfromscratch #recipes #easyrecipes #dip   </p>"},{"location":"posts/bestfruitvideos_26-10-2021_1610/","title":"APPLE ROSE TARTE TATIN - all you need for this luxurious dessert are 3 ingredients you probably already have in your home: apples, store-bought puff pastry and sugar, very minimalistic, but oh, so wonderful","text":"<p>recipe by @bestfruitvideos  (Best Fruit Videos) - see original post</p> <p></p> <p>Ingredients (makes 6 tarts)  </p> <p>2 large red apples 1 sheet of puff pastry 1 cup of sugar  </p> <p>Instructions   </p> <ol> <li> <p>Preheat the oven at 200\u00b0C or 400\u00b0F.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Wash, core, then thinly slice the apples using a sharp knife or a mandolin. Soak them in hot water until they become soft and bendable, for about 4-5 minutes. Don\u2019t worry about them oxidizing too much, they\u2019ll end up turning brown anyway. Feel free to add a drizzle of lemon juice or vinegar in the water if you please.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Roll out the pastry to 2 mm thick. Divide it into 6 strips. Store-bought puff pastry usually comes folded into 3rds, so that should help dividing it.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Place 1/6 of the apples on the top half of each strip, then fold the puff pastry in half to seal the apples in.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Roll the strip filled with apples to form a rose. Cut the excess dough off if necessary. Repeat with the remaining apples.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Once you have the roses, line a muffin tin with parchment paper, then melt 1 cup of sugar in a pan or saucepan. Simply add the sugar in the pan, and place it on medium heat. Don\u2019t stir it using a spoon, just keep an eye on it and tilt the pan as the sugar melts. Lower the heat if necessary, and stop whenever the sugar turns amber.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Pour 1 to 2 soup spoons worth of sugar in each designated spot of the muffin tin. Place the apples roses upside down, with the rose facing the sugar, and press them down.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the puff pastry seems cooked, it should feel hard to the touch and have a light golden color.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Once you take the pan out, allow the roses to rest in the sugar for 5 minutes, then take them out and serve them.

And what better food to start with than tofu?  </p> <p>Usually made with soybeans, tofu originated in China and is widely used in many traditional dishes or often as a protein replacer of meat/fish. Soybeans have an incredibly high protein content, which make them the perfect legume for tofu. But you can also extract the protein and bind it into a soft block from other protein-rich legumes, like chickpeas. The methods vary slightly, as with traditional tofu you\u2019d introduce acidity, which, similar to cheese, makes the liquid curdle, giving you the chance to strain and press It into a firm block. With chickpeas, the protein helps to set the tofu into a soft gelatinous block, also known as Burmese tofu.  </p> <p>I used locally grown @hodmedods\u2019 chickpeas, harvested from the Breckland soils of Norfolk, to turn this into a British tofu. No air miles, and using a crop that\u2019s grown in the UK only since 2019! This is what plant-based food should be about in the future.

Cut into chunky pieces.  In a small jug or bowl whisk together the soy sauce, mirin, brown sugar, apple syrup, minced ginger and garlic. In a large mixing bowl mix together the cornstarch coating. Heat up enough oil to cover the base of your frypan. As the oil is heating, generously toss your tofu in the cornstarch mix to coat. Make sure oil is hot before you begin frying. Fry the tofu for a few minutes, flipping on each side so they become crispy all over then drain on some paper towel and set aside. Empty your pan of any excess oil and wipe down with some paper towel. Return pan to low heat and add your teriyaki sauce. In a small bowl mix dissolve cornstarch and water and add to the sauce, mixing until your sauce begins to thicken. Turn off the heat and add your tofu, tossing to coat in the sauce. Sprinkle with toasted sesame and garnish with spring onions. Serve with hot jasmine rice!  </p> <p>NOTES AIR-FRYING: Coat tofu in cornstarch mix. Spray your air-fryer base in a layer of oil and arrange tofu in a single layer making sure no pieces are touching. Give tofu a good spray of oil on all sides as unsprayed sections will end up in powdery mouthfeels when eating. Airfry for 8 mins at 200\u00baC, flip and spray, and airfare for another 8 minutes. Finish in a pan with by heating the sauce as per above instructions. *MORE SAUCY: simply double the sauce measurements for extra sauce!  </p> <p>#recipes #tofu #tofurecipe #easydinner #easyrecipes   </p>"},{"location":"posts/itslizmiu_08-04-2022_0604/","title":"DULCE DE LECHE REPOSTERO VEGANO aka My Friday apology to everyone I offended by putting caramel in my alfajor cookies a few days ago \ud83d\ude05 Let\u2019s do this thingy properly now.

I never really thought I\u2019d be talking about wellness so enthusiastically on here but since turning 30, it\u2019s truly hit me that my health truly is my greatest asset. It can be super difficult to know where to start (and for me, I find re-starting can be even harder) but @28bySamWood is here and may be the just the thing you need to help you start living happier and healthier. It\u2019s packed with guided workouts (and they range in intensity, so you can pick what feels right - which I love as I\u2019m very much a train-to-how-i-feel kind of person) as well as plenty of recipes. If you need a stronger push you can even opt to start the 8-week challenge - long enough to see results but short enough to see it through.

You don\u2019t have to double fry but it does make them EXXXTRA crispy! Deep fry at 160\u00b0C for a few mins. Then deep fry at 190\u00b0C for a few mins.

I\u2019ve been working on this peach panzanella for a while and it\u2019s finally ready!

Drizzle sourdough with olive oil and a small sprinkle of salt and bake for 15-20 minutes til bread is toasted. Roughly chop tomatoes, place a colander in a bowl and then tomatoes into the colander. Sprinkle over 1 tsp salt and toss for a minute to sweat the tomatoes then leave for 5 minutes so the juices fall into the bowl. Meanwhile roughly chop your cucumber, slice your peaches and mince the garlic and shallot. Whisk white wine vinegar, dijon, salt and pepper, olive oil into the tomato juices. As with most my salads, I like to pour half the dressing out and serve it on the side just incase people don\u2019t like too much dressing (you can\u2019t undress a salad, but it\u2019s easy to add more!). This is also a salad where you want to toss it about 5-10 minutes before serving as the bread will slowly go soggy overtime (the changing texture is beauty of this salad) but I think the sweet spot is after 5-10 minutes of soaking. Toss in the tomatoes, cucumber, peaches, basil and toasted bread with the dressing and serve immediately!   </p> <p>#panzanellasalad #recipes #easyrecipes #summersalad #interestingsalads #goodsalads #peachseason #summer   </p>"},{"location":"posts/jacobking_02-11-2022_1711/","title":"PERI PERI CHICK\u2019N + RICE\ud83d\udc13 doing up Nandos at home with some tofu \ud83e\udd1d","text":"<p>recipe by @jacobking  (Jacob King) - see original post</p> <p></p> <p>\u2b07\ufe0fINGREDIENTS\u2b07\ufe0f  </p> <p>peri peri -1/2 tsp birdseye chilli flakes -1 tsp smoked paprika -1/2 tsp nutritional yeast -1/2 tsp garlic powder -1/2 tsp onion powder -1/2 tsp black pepper -1/2 tsp salt -1 tsp tomato paste -juice of 1/2 lemon -1 tbsp olive oil -1 block firm tofu  </p> <p>spicy ricey -1 cup white rice -1.5 cups vegetable stock -1 tsp turmeric  -1/2 tsp smoked paprika -1/2 tsp cumin -1/2 tsp chilli powder -1/2 cup peas -1 red bell pepper  </p> <p>#chicken #chickendinner #chickenlover #friedchicken #chickenrecipes #periperi #nandos #veganchicken #spicychicken #chickenbowl #rice #ricebowl #tofu #tofurecipes #spicyfood #southafrican #portugal #portuguese   </p>"},{"location":"posts/jacobking_02-12-2022_1712/","title":"(crispy + salty) ROAST POTATOES \ud83e\uddc2\ud83e\udd54 written recipe below \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe","text":"<p>recipe by @jacobking  (Jacob King) - see original post</p> <p></p> <p>\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffeINGREDIENTS\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe -10 large white potatoes  -8 cloves of garlic -few sprigs of fresh thyme  -few sprigs of fresh rosemary and  -big pinch of salt -1 crushed up stock cube -2 tbsp nutritional yeast   </p> <p>\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffeMETHOD\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe -add oil generously to a baking tray or dish then place in a preheated oven @200\u00b0 and allow the oil to get really hot.  -peel, dice and then wash your potatoes. -place the potatoes in cold salted water then bring to a boil.

Start by boiling some salted water, add your chickpeas and garlic into the water, but keep the chickpea brine separate for later. Boil the chickpeas for 20 mins to half an hour. 2. Whilst they\u2019re boiling, grab the jackfruit out of the can and pull it with two forks to make little strips. 3. Heat up some oil in a skillet and add in the jackfruit with the chopped garlic. Cook until charred slightly, then add in the harissa page and the tomatoes. Cook down the tomatoes until the burst and char off the jackfruit. 4. Drain the chickpeas once cooked and add to a blender with the chickpea brine and garlic clove from earlier. Blitz until they form a paste like consistency. 5. Now add in the tahini and blend, then whilst blending add in the ice cubes one at a time. 6. Then add in the cumin, olive oil, salt and lemon juice and blitz one last time or until it\u2019s as smooth as like it. 7. Plate up the hummus, drizzle some olive oil over it, top on the jackfruit and tomatoes and season with fresh parsley and some smoked walnuts and you can blow torch the top of the jackfruit if you like it Smokey!   </p> <p>#hummus #hummusrecipe #hummuslover #veganisrael #vegan #jackfruit #jackfruitrecipes #veganuk #easyvegan #easyrecipes #plantbased   </p>"},{"location":"posts/nomeatdisco_09-08-2022_1608/","title":"CAJUN ORANGE TOFU LOLLIPOPS \ud83c\udf4a \ud83c\udf6d","text":"<p>recipe by @nomeatdisco  (Sam Jones | No Meat Disco) - see original post</p> <p></p> <p>10 minutes that\u2019s all you have left\u2026 what are you guna do with it?

I found the best results with short-grain Japanese and Taiwanese rice; long-grain rice (like basmati, jasmine), glutinous rice, or rice flour all give poor results. Wash the rice like you would for cooking and soak in new water for 2 hrs, at room temp. 2) Drain rice well and add to a high-powered blender along with all ingredients, yeast last. Blend until very, very fine, about 2-3 mins; unblended grains will sink to the bottom, causing problems in the rising / baking process. Now the batter should be warm, about 40 C (105 F), no hotter. 3) Pour the batter into a lightly-greased non-stick loaf pan (consider parchment paper if yours isn\u2019t non-stick). Mine is 24 cm x 10.5 cm x 9 cm. Whichever loaf pan you choose, make sure the batter only comes half-way up initially. 4) Cover and proof at 40 C (I use my oven\u2019s lowest temp) until 1\u00bd times the original size. Take the pan out and preheat the oven to 190 C (375 F). As soon as the batter rises to nearly 2 times the original size, bake uncovered for 35-40 mins, or until golden-brown on top. Be sure to spritz the top with water every now and then, as the rice batter is highly prone to drying-out. 5) Once baked, release the loaf onto a wire rack, to cool. It\u2019s best fresh, but can last a few days in the fridge. . . . #veganbread #bread #vegan #gluten #glitenfree   </p>"},{"location":"posts/plantbased.green_10-04-2022_1304/","title":"TWO INGREDIENT Sticky BBQ Tofu \ud83d\udd25 - for anyone that thinks tofu is boring or can\u2019t taste good.

Seal bag, gently shake to coat and place in fridge to marinade over night or up to 24 hours for max flavor. Preheat oven to 375F. Remove tofu from marinade bag and place on a lined baking sheet.

B) Go fancy/ more indulgent:  Melt 30g vegan butter with 30g brown sugar and 4tsp (to taste) ground cinnamon and smear all over before you roll \u2728 GLAZE for BEFORE baking: 10g vegan butter melted, mixed with about 20ml of soya milk, beat thoroughly and brush all over rolls before putting in oven \u2728 ICING (optional) for final touches \ud83e\udd24 Sugar Glaze: icing powder mixed with water, start with 2 TBSP, and add a little bit of water but by bit,  beat, till no lumps and glaze is smooth, slightly thick texture. Pour all over once buns have cooled down from oven!   </p> <p>\u23f2\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83c\udf73METHOD:  (Pre-heat oven to 180c) 1) Prepare dough:  Warm the milk \ud83e\udd5band butter \ud83e\uddc8together till melted but not too hot or this will affect yeast. 2)Once not too hot, add the yeast and give it about 15 mins to activate. Add your sugar, and salt, and then slowly begin adding the flour bit by bit and start to knead. It\u2019ll be sticky!  3) Flour your surface and then transfer so you can add a bit more dough and knead \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffd. If you over knead it\u2019ll become tough and more chewy once cooked so keep it light!  4) Set in a covered bowl to rise for 50 mins \u23f3or so, it should be quite a lot larger!  5) Once it\u2019s ready, flour your surface and roll it out till about 1/ 1.5cm thick. Now you can choose which filling you\u2019ll go for and spread decently all over the up facing side. Once done, start to roll into a Swiss roll style shape.  6) Cut \ud83d\udd2ainto decent slices, try to keep them the same width so they cook evenly. And place in a baking tray with parchment paper.  7) Brush with your glaze that\u2019s been made for prior to oven baking, for nice golden touch! 8) Cover and leave to rise again for 15 mins.  9) Then BAKE! 30mins should do it depending on your oven and how strong it is! Once out, let cool and then add icing glaze if you want!  10) ENJOY! \ud83e\udd24\u2665\ufe0f   </p>"},{"location":"posts/theegyptianplanteater_06-04-2022_1604/","title":"GOCHUJANG HUMMUS RIGATONI\ud83c\udf5d\ud83c\udf36","text":"<p>recipe by @theegyptianplanteater  (Farida\ud83c\udf38 plant-based foooodie\ud83c\udf31) - see original post</p> <p></p> <p>I love creamy pasta.

Heat a large skillet or non-stick pan over medium high heat. Add some oil to coat the pan. Once hot, add the slabs or pieces of tempeh. Cook the tempeh over medium high heat until golden brown, around 3-4 minutes on each side. Prepare the sauce or marinade by mixing everything in a bowl. Feel free to adjust the sauce to your taste. Pour the marinade or sauce over the tempeh and flip the tempeh to evenly coat in the sauce. Allow the sauce to come to a boil over medium heat. It\u2019ll thicken and turn into a glaze from the sugars. Flip the tempeh to continue to cook in the sauce and coat in the glaze. Once the tempeh has soaked the sauce. you can deglaze the pan with some water. Turn off the heat and then transfer the tempeh into plates. You can slice these into strips if you opted to cook them in square slabs. Serve with rice or noodles. You can also enjoy the tempeh in wraps or salads. Pour the remaining sauce/marinade over the tempeh. Garnish with green onions or sesame seeds, if desired.

Organic is important to make sure it is not treated with anti-growth/sprout products. Your Ginger will need to sprout. \ud83c\udf31 Keep your ginger rhizome indoor in a small plate with water. Spray water every day to keep it humid.  \ud83c\udf31 After a few weeks, it will develop sprouting eyes. Stems will develop and grow from these eyes.  \ud83c\udf31 Plant your rhizome in a pot of 4L / 1 Gallon, water regularly &amp; keep indoor at warmth. Green stems will develop in a few weeks.  \ud83c\udf31 After your last spring frost date, plant out outdoor in a bigger pot of minimum 20L/ 5 Gallon. You can add some mulch. Place in half sun half shade location. Water regularly.  \ud83c\udf31 Without any big maintenance, after 9/10 months, your ginger will be ready for harvest. The taste of homegrown ginger has truly no comparison. Fresh &amp; tasty!  </p> <p>Indeed Ginger has also many health benefits. I love to have a shot of ginger/turmeric in the morning!

Let\u2019s talk about sugar \ud83c\udf6c for a sec. A friend asked, \u201cAren\u2019t all sugars \ud83c\udf69\ud83c\udf47 the same? They have the same calories.\u201d We know now it\u2019s WAY more complicated than that. Although similar, the sugar in bananas \ud83c\udf4c (mostly fructose) isn\u2019t even the same compound as white sugar \ud83c\udf6c (sucrose) or the sugar made primarily in fermentation\ud83c\udf7a (maltose). . On top of these differences, foods are more than the sum of their parts, so for your body, fructose in a banana \u2260 the fructose in high fructose corn syrup \ud83c\udf3d. The sugar in fruit comes with fiber, vitamins, minerals, &amp; phytochemicals that behave synergistically. This is why they actually PREVENT diabetes. See my last post! \ud83d\udc40 .  The gut does a pretty cool job of showing how food is more than calories. Foods WITHOUT calories can be worse than sugar \ud83c\udf6d. One study \ud83d\udcd6 done on the effects of artificial sweeteners on the microbiome demonstrated that artificial sweeteners, when compared to normal sugar, led to glucose intolerance by messing with the microbiome, while other studies have found an association \ud83d\udcc8 between artificial sweetener consumption and weight gain. \u2696\ufe0f . Bottom line: WHOLE FOODS is the way to go. . DIRECTIONS:  Extra ripe frozen bananas \ud83c\udf4c, a splash of nut milk, and a teaspoon of vanilla in the  blender and BZZZZ \ud83c\udf2a.

Similar to the rye, it is baked in a dish, meaning that you skip the more challenging stages of shaping it by hand, letting it proof in a basket and then placing it into your casserole. It also means, that you can use a higher hydration, resulting in a well risen bread with a soft inside and a thin crunchy crust.  </p> <p>Traditionally, you\u2019d use honey, which I\u2019ve substituted with sugar. The glucose speeds up the fermentation, creating a beautifully open structured with a noticeable tangy flavour. If you\u2019d like the flavour less dominant, simply reduce the time in the fridge by a couple of hours or leave out the sugar. The focaccia also makes a mean sub, like the Roasted Aubergine Focaccia Sandwich (coming soon \ud83d\udc4f)  </p> <p>. .  </p> <p>#tastyvegan\u00a0#veganmealshare\u00a0#veganrecipeshare\u00a0#veganrecipeideas\u00a0#veganmealideas\u00a0#plantbasedrecipe\u00a0#plantbasedmeals\u00a0#vegandiet\u00a0#veganmom\u00a0#veganfoodrecipes\u00a0#plantbasedfoodie\u00a0#plantbasedmeal\u00a0#veganmealprep\u00a0#plantbasediet\u00a0#healthyveganfood\u00a0#veganlifestyleblogger\u00a0#plantbasedfoods\u00a0#veganbowls\u00a0#healthyveganrecipes #veganlover\u00a0#veganlife\ud83c\udf31\u00a0#veganfoodpornshare\u00a0#vegandinnerideas\u00a0#veganfoodies\u00a0#eatplantsnotanimials\u00a0#whatveganscook\u00a0#eeatyourvegetables\u00a0#buddhabowls\u00a0#vegancookbook   </p>"},{"location":"posts/veganbarrel_22-10-2021_1410/","title":"Typed up a huge list of all the fall recipes I want to make &amp; these APPLE CINNAMON ROLLS just had to come first \ud83e\udd29\ud83c\udf42 So fun &amp; easy to make \u3030\ufe0f 4 ingredient dough, 4 ingredient filling \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc by @hannahharvestinghealth !","text":"<p>recipe by @veganbarrel  (Being Vegan) - see original post</p> <p></p> <p>\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 Apple Cinnamon Rolls: i n g r e d i e n t s- 2 cups all purpose flour {I used\u00a0@bobsredmill\u00a01:1 gf baking flour} 2 tsp. baking powder 1/4 cup melted butter 2/3 cup almond milk \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 f i l l i n g- 1/4 cup coconut sugar 1 tbsp. cinnamon 1/2 cup softened butter 1 apple {finely diced} \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 d i r e c t i o n s- 1.

Drain the potatoes and transfer to a baking tray. Press the potatoes down using the bottom of a glass or a potato masher to flatten them. The skin will break open. Press them so they are flattened but not breaking apart, about 2.5-3cm / 1 inch thick. 4. Drizzle over the olive oil and salt. 5. Bake for 30 minutes, then check colour. Depending on your oven, to get them SUPER crispy they may need another 10 - 20 minutes. Keep checking on them every 10 minutes until they are golden and starting to brown around the edges. 6. Serve immediately with dipping sauce of choice, garnish with parsley.  </p> <p>#veganrecipeshare #veganrecipies #veganrecepies #veganproblems #veganlover #veganfeed #veganrecipeideas #veganeatsplease #veganweek #vegangram #veganeating #veganrecovery #simplevegan #veganrules #veganinstaclub #veganteen #veganworldshare #vegandinners #vegantips #veganheaven #veganislife #veganhealthy #veganeasy #vegansoninstagram #veganlifestlye #veganyum #veganraw   </p>"},{"location":"posts/vegandiaries____07-06-2022_1006/","title":"Would you try bang bang cauliflower?!

Thinly slice them with a mandolin. Add sliced potatoes to a large mixing bowl, cover with melted plant-based butter, a generous pinch of salt and black pepper.  Line a loaf pan with parchment paper and begin to layer each slice of potato, one-by-one. Cover with parchment paper and bake at 120C/250F for almost 2 hours. Remove potatoes from the oven, then press down with a few tins cans or something heavy. Place in the fridge overnight or up to 12 hours. The next day, remove the potatoes from the fridge and cut 1\u201d slices. Heat vegetable oil to 375F/190C and lower potatoes slowly and carefully.  Deep frying for 3-5 minutes until golden brown and of course, CRISPY! Remove from oil, place on a cooling rack. Once cooled, sprinkle with salt.

It is a Japanese rendition of dan dan noodles but not like the original Sichuan version, and more like the soupy Hong Kong version. Its broth is timid on spice but no less complex; boldly umami, drunk on sesame and chili, yet attentive to the subtle notes of tang and sweet. Clinging to those springy alkaline noodles are bits of miso mince topping, which are so meaty they might send you into an existential trance. Indeed, who am I without a bowl of spicy noodles?  </p> <p>THE RECIPE (for 2) Broth: 2 cups (480 g) water 6 (25 g) dried shiitake mushrooms 1 large piece (15 g) kombu 1\u00bc cup (300 g) barista oat milk  </p> <p>Scallion oil: \u00be cup (170 g) vegetable oil 4-5 (100 g) scallions, chopped 2 inch ginger, roughly chopped  </p> <p>Nikumiso: 2 Tbsp scallion oil, for frying \u00bd block (200 g) firm or extra-firm tofu 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 inch ginger, minced 1 scallion, minced 2 Tbsp dark-brown miso 1 Tbsp soy sauce 2 Tbsp mirin 1 tsp sugar  </p> <p>Each bowl: 1\u00bd Tbsp sesame paste 1 Tbsp chili oil 1 tsp scallion oil \u00bd tsp toasted sesame oil 1\u00bd Tbsp soy sauce \u00bd tsp rice vinegar 1 Tbsp zha cai, minced 1\u00bd cup (360 g) broth 1 portion (200 g) ramen noodles 1 head bok choy, blanched  </p> <p>NOTES 1.

Pair with nutty sesame, peanut, sesame oil, and you\u2019ve got something addictively good. \ud83e\udd62","text":"<p>recipe by @veganfixes  (Vegan Fixes) - see original post</p> <p></p> <p>THE RECIPE (serves 4): 2 (400 g) asian eggplants, I used taiwanese \u53f0\u7063\u8304\u5b50 6 cloves garlic, grated and divided \u849c\u672b 1 Tbsp sesame paste \u829d\u9ebb\u91ac 1 Tbsp peanut butter \u82b1\u751f\u91ac 2 Tbsp lao gan ma chili crisp, or chili oil of choice \u8fa3\u6912\u6cb9 1 tsp toasted sesame oil \u9ebb\u6cb9 1\u00bd Tbsp light soy sauce \u751f\u62bd/\u91ac\u6cb9 1 tsp dark soy sauce \u8001\u62bd 1 Tbsp black vinegar \u70cf\u918b 2 Tbsp water \u6c34 \u00bc-\u00bd tsp salt \u9e7d \u00bd tsp sugar \u7cd6 1 scallion and/or 2 sprigs cilantro, chopped \u5c0f\u8525/\u9999\u83dc 1 tsp toasted sesame seeds \u719f\u829d\u9ebb  </p> <p>NOTES: 1. Choose fresh and young eggplants; these have white tops and firm, dark-purple skin with no green scars. They also have white flesh, less seeds, and taste sweet instead of bitter. I soak them for 2-3 mins in a vinegar bath (1 cup water, 2 Tbsp white vinegar, \u00bc tsp salt) to retain that vibrant purple color; they won\u2019t taste acidic, actually a little sweeter.  </p> <ol> <li> <p>The eggplants must be cooked at a heat above 100 C (212 F), to lock in the color. This is why most cooks pass them through oil (\u904e\u6cb9). I\u2019ve had my fair share of unappetizing, green-ish brown steamed eggplants, to finally learn that you have to steam with the skins facing down (direct contact with heat). I also recommend using a wide flat-bottomed steamer that has holes throughout, so you can lay the eggplants in a single layer. Steam on high for 5-8 mins \u2014 you want them extra soft if eating cold.  </p> </li> <li> <p>You can \u201cliang ban\u201d basically anything; think long, thin matchsticks, good vehicles for sauce \u2014 cucumbers, bamboo shoots, carrots, beansprouts, or nature\u2019s julienne, enoki mushrooms. The sauce, then, is usually a vinegar-based dressing, perfumed with garlic, sesame oil, and/or chili oil. This is a sesame version.  </p> </li> </ol> <p>. . . . . . .   </p>"},{"location":"posts/veganfixes_26-11-2021_1911/","title":"\ud83d\ude0d 60% OFF BLACK FRIDAY SALE Happening on this Epic Sushi Set right now at our LINK IN BIO\ud83d\udd25","text":"<p>recipe by @veganfixes  (Vegan Fixes) - see original post</p> <p></p> <p>.

Perhaps my most favorite salad and dressing combo so far! If you have tried and liked my other ShredHappens salad recipes, I have a feeling you\u2019ll really enjoy this one. . The spicy cashew dressing is full of flavor - the cashew, ginger, lime, and garlic, combined with the rice vinegar just go so so well together. You have the option of adding some pepper or extra chili flakes for more of a kick and that\u2019s when things really get interesting! . Here is how I made it: . 1.Lets start with our base. You can use anything you like here, but I personally prefer this combination. Shred up 1/2 small purple cabbage (finely shred is the way to go, this is ShredHappens after all, \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude02!), add into a bow, then finely dice/chop up 3 Persian cucumbers, 1 red bell pepper, 2 scallions, half a small shallot, handful of fresh cilantro, and 1 small avocado. . 2.Add those all into a bowl, then lets get the spicy cashew dressing going. . 3.In a small food process or blender, add 1/2 cup cashews, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1.5 tablespoons sesame oil, 3 tablespoons rice vinegar, 3 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari, 2.5 tablespoons nutritional yeast, 1 chunk of ginger, 2 cloves of garlic, green chili or pepper of choice (based on your spicy preference), juice of 2 limes, a small handful of cilantro, red chili flakes to taste, and a small pinch of sea salt. . 4.Give the dressing a good blend, give it a taste, then add more of what you like. You\u2019ll probably want to adjust acidity by adding more lime juice, or bring out the flavors by adding more salt, or control the spicy level by adding more cashews if you want it less spicy or more chili flakes if you want it more spicy. . 5.Top your dressing with the dressing, top with white sesame seeds, give it a good toss, then enjoy as is, with some lowcarb chips/crackers, or as a side to your main dish. . If you give this a try, be sure to tag me or let me know what you think! I love seeing you guys remake my recipes. .
