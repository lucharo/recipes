To make this treat dairy-free I used @earthsown \u2018s Almond Unsweetened Original, it has a rich and creamy taste that I really love. I left instructions for you to be able to make this recipe even if you don\u2019t have an ice cream machine, enjoy! @eatwithafia Cool down this summer with some of my favourite and new to me drinks from the African continent. Today, we are making tamarind juice or Lamurji. It\u2019s a spicy, tarte, seeet and perfect for the summer @crowded_kitchen MANGO LIME SORBET \ud83e\udd6d\ud83c\udf68 Island way sorbet who?? Make it yourself with wayyy less sugar and no dairy for the cutest (and most delicious!) summer treat. Serve it up in a mango half or just freeze it in a regular container (it\u2019s equally delicious both ways \ud83d\ude09) @zaccharybird TEMPE KECAP! If you\u2019ve never enjoyed tempeh before, it\u2019s probably your own fault. Begin your apology tour with this GLORIOUSLY CRISPY recipe that you\u2019ll often find served up as a part of Nasi Campur (Indonesian Mixed Rice) when eating in Bali. Oh, you could just come on our totally vegan foodie tour of Bali, instead. @abc_everyday Homemade Garlic and Sesame Chilli Crisp to put on anything and everything with @itslizmiu! \ud83c\udf36 @itslizmiu Portuguese Saltcod Fritters \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf9\ud83d\udc1fBolinhos/Pasteis de Bacalhau (plant-based) @itslizmiu Portuguese Tomato Rice (Arroz de Tomate) \ud83c\udf45 Inspired by recent travels to cook some Portuguese goodness this week! Missing the sun and the warmth \ud83e\udd72 I adore tomato rice and when I found out Portugal had a version I had to try it and wow. So comforting, garlicky, satisfying and flavourful. It\u2019s saucy and kinda like a tomato-ey porridge - I love it. @fitgreenmind SHREDDED TOFU TACOS \ud83c\udf2e @the.undisputable.vegans \ud83e\udd6d Mangum @primal_gourmet Blackened Snapper with Mango Salsa\u2026 easy, healthy and bursting with flavour. Perfect meal for this incredible Miami weather. I served it with some steamed rice but you can easily keep things Paleo and Whole30 by serving it with some grilled or steamed veggies, plantains or roasted sweet potatoes. It also makes for an incredible taco! @pierceabernathy Greens are everywhere at the market and I\u2019ve been buying dandelions non-stop. Slightly bitter, a bit earthy and packed full of nutrients I think they lend themselves perfectly to a simple pasta sauce.

Growing up I always knew tempe to be fried til crispy and often coated in a sticky or spicy sauce, which is the way the Indonesians do it (my Nini is from Java)! It\u2019s often served alongside meat dishes - and all Indonesians know and love it, not just the vegetarian or vegan ones! So I say - more tempe for everyone! If you\u2019ve tried it and didn\u2019t like it - give it another chance with this easy and delicious Sambal Goreng Tempe! @jensplantbase Chick\u2019n & Plantain Waffles - a plant based-alternative made with enoki mushrooms!

Lavo le foglie di cavolo nero sotto acqua corrente e le asciugo poi con un panno pulito (non buttare via i gambi, sono ottimi nel brodo vegetale) Preparo il condimento versando l\u2019olio in una ciotolina e aggiungo il sale, l\u2019aglio schiacciato e la scorza di un limone bio grattugiata. Spennello la superficie delle foglie di cavolo nero su entrambi i lati e cuocio in forno.

It\u2019s saucy and kinda like a tomato-ey porridge - I love it. @fitgreenmind SHREDDED TOFU TACOS \ud83c\udf2e @the.undisputable.vegans \ud83e\udd6d Mangum @primal_gourmet Blackened Snapper with Mango Salsa\u2026 easy, healthy and bursting with flavour. Perfect meal for this incredible Miami weather. I served it with some steamed rice but you can easily keep things Paleo and Whole30 by serving it with some grilled or steamed veggies, plantains or roasted sweet potatoes. It also makes for an incredible taco! @pierceabernathy Greens are everywhere at the market and I\u2019ve been buying dandelions non-stop. Slightly bitter, a bit earthy and packed full of nutrients I think they lend themselves perfectly to a simple pasta sauce. Feel free to use spinach, chard, mustard, kale, or any other greens you can get your hands on. @carolinagelen Follow @carolinagelen for more recipes @carolinagelen follow @carolinagelen for more recipes @carolinagelen follow @carolinagelen for more recipes @thefoodietakesflight Garlic Pepper Tofu! \ud83e\udd62 @vegandemocracy EAT OR PASS?? \ud83d\ude0d @thefoodietakesflight Pan-Fried Scallion & Sesame Buns for all the amazing mothers out there \ud83c\udf38 @abc_everyday SAMBAL GORENG TEMPE(H) by @itslizmiu \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\udde9 If you don\u2019t like tempe, try it a more traditional way! Growing up I always knew tempe to be fried til crispy and often coated in a sticky or spicy sauce, which is the way the Indonesians do it (my Nini is from Java)! It\u2019s often served alongside meat dishes - and all Indonesians know and love it, not just the vegetarian or vegan ones! So I say - more tempe for everyone! If you\u2019ve tried it and didn\u2019t like it - give it another chance with this easy and delicious Sambal Goreng Tempe! @jensplantbase Chick\u2019n & Plantain Waffles - a plant based-alternative made with enoki mushrooms! Another one of those mushrooms with all the texture and no strong mushroom flavors. It pretty much takes on any seasoning you pair it with.

And what better food to start with than tofu? Usually made with soybeans, tofu originated in China and is widely used in many traditional dishes or often as a protein replacer of meat/fish. Soybeans have an incredibly high protein content, which make them the perfect legume for tofu. But you can also extract the protein and bind it into a soft block from other protein-rich legumes, like chickpeas. The methods vary slightly, as with traditional tofu you\u2019d introduce acidity, which, similar to cheese, makes the liquid curdle, giving you the chance to strain and press It into a firm block. With chickpeas, the protein helps to set the tofu into a soft gelatinous block, also known as Burmese tofu. I used locally grown @hodmedods\u2019 chickpeas, harvested from the Breckland soils of Norfolk, to turn this into a British tofu.

And what better food to start with than tofu? Usually made with soybeans, tofu originated in China and is widely used in many traditional dishes or often as a protein replacer of meat/fish. Soybeans have an incredibly high protein content, which make them the perfect legume for tofu. But you can also extract the protein and bind it into a soft block from other protein-rich legumes, like chickpeas. The methods vary slightly, as with traditional tofu you\u2019d introduce acidity, which, similar to cheese, makes the liquid curdle, giving you the chance to strain and press It into a firm block. With chickpeas, the protein helps to set the tofu into a soft gelatinous block, also known as Burmese tofu. I used locally grown @hodmedods\u2019 chickpeas, harvested from the Breckland soils of Norfolk, to turn this into a British tofu.

Wash, core, then thinly slice the apples using a sharp knife or a mandolin. Soak them in hot water until they become soft and bendable, for about 4-5 minutes. Don\u2019t worry about them oxidizing too much, they\u2019ll end up turning brown anyway. Feel free to add a drizzle of lemon juice or vinegar in the water if you please. Roll out the pastry to 2 mm thick. Divide it into 6 strips. Store-bought puff pastry usually comes folded into 3rds, so that should help dividing it. Place 1/6 of the apples on the top half of each strip, then fold the puff pastry in half to seal the apples in. Roll the strip filled with apples to form a rose. Cut the excess dough off if necessary. Repeat with the remaining apples. Once you have the roses, line a muffin tin with parchment paper, then melt 1 cup of sugar in a pan or saucepan. Simply add the sugar in the pan, and place it on medium heat. Don\u2019t stir it using a spoon, just keep an eye on it and tilt the pan as the sugar melts. Lower the heat if necessary, and stop whenever the sugar turns amber. Pour 1 to 2 soup spoons worth of sugar in each designated spot of the muffin tin. Place the apples roses upside down, with the rose facing the sugar, and press them down. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the puff pastry seems cooked, it should feel hard to the touch and have a light golden color. Once you take the pan out, allow the roses to rest in the sugar for 5 minutes, then take them out and serve them.

Make it yourself with wayyy less sugar and no dairy for the cutest (and most delicious!) summer treat. Serve it up in a mango half or just freeze it in a regular container (it\u2019s equally delicious both ways \ud83d\ude09) recipe by @crowded_kitchen (Crowded Kitchen | Lexi & Beth) - see original post Bookmark the RECIPE: 5 cups frozen mango 1/4-1/3 cup freshly squeezed lime juice 1/4-1/3 cup agave or honey If you want to serve these in mango halves, slice the mango and use a spoon to remove the fruit. It took about 5 mangos to get 5 cups. Transfer to a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and freeze until frozen solid (~2 hours). Add all ingredients to a food processor or blender and blend until completely smooth. This may take a minute or two since the mango is frozen. Stop to scrape down the sides in between blending to make sure everything is incorporated. Enjoy right away for a soft serve style, or scoop into mango halves and return to the freezer until set (2-3 hours). You can adjust the lime juice and agave/honey to your preference! I personally love it with lots of lime juice and just a tiny bit of sweetener. If your mango is perfectly ripe, it should be naturally sweet enough on its own!

And what better food to start with than tofu? Usually made with soybeans, tofu originated in China and is widely used in many traditional dishes or often as a protein replacer of meat/fish. Soybeans have an incredibly high protein content, which make them the perfect legume for tofu. But you can also extract the protein and bind it into a soft block from other protein-rich legumes, like chickpeas. The methods vary slightly, as with traditional tofu you\u2019d introduce acidity, which, similar to cheese, makes the liquid curdle, giving you the chance to strain and press It into a firm block. With chickpeas, the protein helps to set the tofu into a soft gelatinous block, also known as Burmese tofu. I used locally grown @hodmedods\u2019 chickpeas, harvested from the Breckland soils of Norfolk, to turn this into a British tofu. No air miles, and using a crop that\u2019s grown in the UK only since 2019! This is what plant-based food should be about in the future.

Cut into chunky pieces. In a small jug or bowl whisk together the soy sauce, mirin, brown sugar, apple syrup, minced ginger and garlic. In a large mixing bowl mix together the cornstarch coating. Heat up enough oil to cover the base of your frypan. As the oil is heating, generously toss your tofu in the cornstarch mix to coat. Make sure oil is hot before you begin frying. Fry the tofu for a few minutes, flipping on each side so they become crispy all over then drain on some paper towel and set aside. Empty your pan of any excess oil and wipe down with some paper towel. Return pan to low heat and add your teriyaki sauce. In a small bowl mix dissolve cornstarch and water and add to the sauce, mixing until your sauce begins to thicken. Turn off the heat and add your tofu, tossing to coat in the sauce. Sprinkle with toasted sesame and garnish with spring onions. Serve with hot jasmine rice! NOTES AIR-FRYING: Coat tofu in cornstarch mix. Spray your air-fryer base in a layer of oil and arrange tofu in a single layer making sure no pieces are touching.

Start by making your pandan juice. Blend water and pandan leaves then strain in a cheese cloth to get pandan juice. In a large mixing bowl sift in the flour, add salt and baking powder and whisk to combine. Add @chefschoicefoods coconut milk, pandan juice, oil and flavouring and whisk til you have a smooth batter. In a small saucepan add the pandan juice and palm sugar and heat until sugar is just dissolved. Add your hydrated coconut and cook until sticky. Turn heat off and set aside In a non-stick pan brush or spray a VERY LIGHT layer of oil, too much and the edges will get too crispy (a little bit of crisp is okay as they should soften). Heat pan on low heat until hot. I recommend doing a test pancake first. Pour 1/3 cup scoop of batter into the middle and swirl into a circle. Cook for a few minutes, flip, then cook until just set. Place onto a plate. It should be a thin crepe - if it\u2019s too thick add a little water. If your pancake is tearing or breaking, add 2 tsp of flour to the batter and do another test pancake.

Try to drain out as much water as humanely possible then dry between two tea towels. Cook potato and salt in some oil for 4-5 mins until potato gets tender but not mushy - it\u2019ll start to look kinda glassy. (Cooking the potato first basically means the potato doesn\u2019t have to cook when you fry it, and just needs to get crispy) Transfer to a bowl and mix with cornstarch. Mixture may feel dry and that\u2019s okay, but should clump together when you squeeze tightly. Working with the warm mix, squeeze small handfuls into nuggets and then squish flat. Freeze overnight. You don\u2019t have to double fry but it does make them EXXXTRA crispy! Deep fry at 160\u00b0C for a few mins. Then deep fry at 190\u00b0C for a few mins.

I\u2019ve been working on this peach panzanella for a while and it\u2019s finally ready! This is my twist on the traditional Tuscan tomato and bread salad and I think that the sweet yellow peaches just go so nicely with the light vinaigrette and also add to the salad visually. recipe by @itslizmiu (Liz Miu \u82d7\u53ef\u7389 \ud83c\udf50) - see original post SALAD 300g sourdough, cubed 2 tbsp olive oil 6 really ripe juicy tomatoes 1 tsp salt 1 cucumber, optional 2 very ripe yellow peaches 1 cup basil DRESSING 2 tbsp white wine vinegar 1 tsp dijon mustard 1/2 cup olive oil 2 cloves garlic 1/4 red onion or 1 small shallot Salt and pepper to taste **RIPENING TIP: I like to ripen my tomatoes and peaches at room temperature for a few days after buying for extra juicy tomatoes and extra sweet peaches and I pop them into the fridge the night before making this salad. METHOD Preheat oven to 180\u00baC. Drizzle sourdough with olive oil and a small sprinkle of salt and bake for 15-20 minutes til bread is toasted. Roughly chop tomatoes, place a colander in a bowl and then tomatoes into the colander. Sprinkle over 1 tsp salt and toss for a minute to sweat the tomatoes then leave for 5 minutes so the juices fall into the bowl. Meanwhile roughly chop your cucumber, slice your peaches and mince the garlic and shallot. Whisk white wine vinegar, dijon, salt and pepper, olive oil into the tomato juices. As with most my salads, I like to pour half the dressing out and serve it on the side just incase people don\u2019t like too much dressing (you can\u2019t undress a salad, but it\u2019s easy to add more!). This is also a salad where you want to toss it about 5-10 minutes before serving as the bread will slowly go soggy overtime (the changing texture is beauty of this salad) but I think the sweet spot is after 5-10 minutes of soaking.

Start by boiling some salted water, add your chickpeas and garlic into the water, but keep the chickpea brine separate for later. Boil the chickpeas for 20 mins to half an hour. 2. Whilst they\u2019re boiling, grab the jackfruit out of the can and pull it with two forks to make little strips. 3. Heat up some oil in a skillet and add in the jackfruit with the chopped garlic.

Drain the chickpeas once cooked and add to a blender with the chickpea brine and garlic clove from earlier. Blitz until they form a paste like consistency. 5.

Then add in the cumin, olive oil, salt and lemon juice and blitz one last time or until it\u2019s as smooth as like it. 7. Plate up the hummus, drizzle some olive oil over it, top on the jackfruit and tomatoes and season with fresh parsley and some smoked walnuts and you can blow torch the top of the jackfruit if you like it Smokey! #hummus #hummusrecipe #hummuslover #veganisrael #vegan #jackfruit #jackfruitrecipes #veganuk #easyvegan #easyrecipes #plantbased","title":"THE CREAMIEST HUMMUS EVER WITH HARISSA JACKFRUIT \ud83e\uded8"},{"location":"posts/nomeatdisco_07-08-2022_1508/#the-creamiest-hummus-ever-with-harissa-jackfruit","text":"recipe by @nomeatdisco (\u2022 Sam | No Meat Disco \u2022) - see original post Hands down this is the creamiest hummus I\u2019ve eaten.

Set aside and reserve cooking liquid. 4. In a large saucepan on medium heat, add roughly half of the celeriac sauce along with the butter. Stir to combine. Add the grated Parmesan and black pepper and stir to combine. If too thick, add a few splashes of the celeriac cooking liquid. 5. Add in the squash and stir to combine. Taste and adjust for salt if desired. 6. Immediately transfer to a bowl and garnish with more grated parmesan, freshly cracked black pepper, and olive oil. #easyrecipes #spaghettisquash #cacioepepe #asmrfood","title":"Cacio e Pepe inspired spaghetti squash dip.

I found the best results with short-grain Japanese and Taiwanese rice; long-grain rice (like basmati, jasmine), glutinous rice, or rice flour all give poor results. Wash the rice like you would for cooking and soak in new water for 2 hrs, at room temp. 2) Drain rice well and add to a high-powered blender along with all ingredients, yeast last. Blend until very, very fine, about 2-3 mins; unblended grains will sink to the bottom, causing problems in the rising / baking process. Now the batter should be warm, about 40 C (105 F), no hotter. 3) Pour the batter into a lightly-greased non-stick loaf pan (consider parchment paper if yours isn\u2019t non-stick). Mine is 24 cm x 10.5 cm x 9 cm. Whichever loaf pan you choose, make sure the batter only comes half-way up initially. 4) Cover and proof at 40 C (I use my oven\u2019s lowest temp) until 1\u00bd times the original size. Take the pan out and preheat the oven to 190 C (375 F). As soon as the batter rises to nearly 2 times the original size, bake uncovered for 35-40 mins, or until golden-brown on top. Be sure to spritz the top with water every now and then, as the rice batter is highly prone to drying-out. 5) Once baked, release the loaf onto a wire rack, to cool.

Place tofu on a clean working surface and taking either a toothpick or needle, poke holes all over the surface of your tofu. Cut a shallow crosshatch pattern into both sides of your tofu. Mix marinade ingredients in a bowl, place tofu into a resealable bag and pour marinade overtop the tofu. Seal bag, gently shake to coat and place in fridge to marinade over night or up to 24 hours for max flavor. Preheat oven to 375F. Remove tofu from marinade bag and place on a lined baking sheet. Place whole cloves into each crosshatch intersection and then place tofu into the oven for 25 minutes. As you remove tofu from the oven, prepare glaze by combining brown sugar and mustard together in a mug. Place in the microwave to warm up for 15 seconds then stir to make a sauce. Carefully baste tofu with a portion of the glaze until it is covered and place back in the oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and with a fork, remove the cloves and brush tofu with more glaze. Place tofu back into the oven and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes or until tofu edges appear to crisp. Remove from oven and allow to rest.

I left instructions for you to be able to make this recipe even if you don\u2019t have an ice cream machine, enjoy! recipe by @plantcrazii (Lloyd Rose) - see original post Pistachio Ice Cream 120g unshelled and unsalted pistachios 280ml Earth\u2019s Own Almond Unsweetened Original 200ml full fat canned coconut milk 3 tbsp sweetener of choice (coconut sugar, brown sugar, cane sugar, vegan white sugar) 1/8 tsp salt 1 tbsp melted coconut oil 1 scoop vanilla protein powder 1//4 cup of chopped pistachios for garnish. Add the pistachios to a blender, alternate the speed from low medium to high until the pistachios have broken down into small bits. A little at a time, pour in the Earth\u2019s Own Almond Unsweetened Original while blending. Blend until the mixture becomes smooth and chunk free. Add in the remaining ingredients except for the chopped pistachios(garnish) and blend until combined. If you have an ice cream machine, add the mixture to the machine. If you don\u2019t have an ice cream machine, transfer the mixture to a metal or glass container then cover it with parchment paper. Press the parchment paper down onto the cream to avoid air from getting in during the freeze process. Place it in the freezer. After 2 hours, remove it from the freezer and give the mixture a mix and add in the chopped pistachios. This mixing process will help you avoid ice crystals in the final product. Cover and place the mixture back into the freezer for 24 hours.

Add the pistachios to a blender, alternate the speed from low medium to high until the pistachios have broken down into small bits. A little at a time, pour in the Earth\u2019s Own Almond Unsweetened Original while blending. Blend until the mixture becomes smooth and chunk free. Add in the remaining ingredients except for the chopped pistachios(garnish) and blend until combined. If you have an ice cream machine, add the mixture to the machine. If you don\u2019t have an ice cream machine, transfer the mixture to a metal or glass container then cover it with parchment paper. Press the parchment paper down onto the cream to avoid air from getting in during the freeze process. Place it in the freezer. After 2 hours, remove it from the freezer and give the mixture a mix and add in the chopped pistachios. This mixing process will help you avoid ice crystals in the final product. Cover and place the mixture back into the freezer for 24 hours. Remove it from the freezer the next day and allow it to taw until it becomes easy to scoop (approximately 15 minutes). #icecream #dessert #highprotein #easyrecipes #foodies #foodblogger #foodporn #yummy #foodinsta #instafood #plantbasedrecipes #veganrecipes #vegetarian #explore #foodaesthetic #goodvibes #food","title":"I\u2019m excited about sharing this High Protein Pistachio Ice Cream with you because it\u2019s so darn good!

Wash, core, then thinly slice the apples using a sharp knife or a mandolin. Soak them in hot water until they become soft and bendable, for about 4-5 minutes. Don\u2019t worry about them oxidizing too much, they\u2019ll end up turning brown anyway. Feel free to add a drizzle of lemon juice or vinegar in the water if you please. Roll out the pastry to 2 mm thick. Divide it into 6 strips. Store-bought puff pastry usually comes folded into 3rds, so that should help dividing it. Place 1/6 of the apples on the top half of each strip, then fold the puff pastry in half to seal the apples in. Roll the strip filled with apples to form a rose. Cut the excess dough off if necessary. Repeat with the remaining apples. Once you have the roses, line a muffin tin with parchment paper, then melt 1 cup of sugar in a pan or saucepan. Simply add the sugar in the pan, and place it on medium heat. Don\u2019t stir it using a spoon, just keep an eye on it and tilt the pan as the sugar melts. Lower the heat if necessary, and stop whenever the sugar turns amber. Pour 1 to 2 soup spoons worth of sugar in each designated spot of the muffin tin. Place the apples roses upside down, with the rose facing the sugar, and press them down.

Wash, core, then thinly slice the apples using a sharp knife or a mandolin. Soak them in hot water until they become soft and bendable, for about 4-5 minutes. Don\u2019t worry about them oxidizing too much, they\u2019ll end up turning brown anyway. Feel free to add a drizzle of lemon juice or vinegar in the water if you please. Roll out the pastry to 2 mm thick. Divide it into 6 strips. Store-bought puff pastry usually comes folded into 3rds, so that should help dividing it. Place 1/6 of the apples on the top half of each strip, then fold the puff pastry in half to seal the apples in. Roll the strip filled with apples to form a rose. Cut the excess dough off if necessary. Repeat with the remaining apples. Once you have the roses, line a muffin tin with parchment paper, then melt 1 cup of sugar in a pan or saucepan. Simply add the sugar in the pan, and place it on medium heat. Don\u2019t stir it using a spoon, just keep an eye on it and tilt the pan as the sugar melts. Lower the heat if necessary, and stop whenever the sugar turns amber. Pour 1 to 2 soup spoons worth of sugar in each designated spot of the muffin tin. Place the apples roses upside down, with the rose facing the sugar, and press them down. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the puff pastry seems cooked, it should feel hard to the touch and have a light golden color. Once you take the pan out, allow the roses to rest in the sugar for 5 minutes, then take them out and serve them.

Then transfer the cashews to a plate and drizzle a little oil in the wok. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Add the shallots and fry for 2 minutes. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Then add the cabbage and fry for another 2 minutes. 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Add the spring onion and garlic and fry for 1 minute. 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Now throw in the noodles and cashews from earlier, followed by the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, maple syrup and sesame oil and stir until combined and hot. Then serve. Enjoy! Roxy + Ben Notes: \u270f\ufe0f We use straight-to-wok style udon noodles, also known as \u2018quick cook\u2019 noodles, which only require minute in a hot pan to cook through. Alternatively you can use dry noodles and cook them separately in a pot of hot water, then drain them and add them to the wok. \u270f\ufe0f We use regular green cabbage, which is the most common variety you\u2019ll find in supermarkets. But you can also use Chinese cabbage (also known as napa cabbage) or even Savoy cabbage. \u270f\ufe0f You can always throw in any other veggies you might have lying around. Courgette, carrot and mushrooms will work really well in this recipe too.","title":"You\u2019ll also find this recipe in our APP and on our website \u270c\ufe0f"},{"location":"posts/sweatspace_16-03-2022_0003/","text":"Creamy Avocado Yoast recipe by @sweatspace (Mike Martin) - see original post Sourdough topped with a spicy avocado yogurt spread made with @siggisdairy plain yogurt, avocado, garlic, cilantro, jalape\u00f1o, lime, chipotle, cayenne pepper, salt For the spicy avocado spread, add the following to a food processor: 3 cloves garlic, 1 jalape\u00f1o deseeded or keep some seeds if you want it more spicy, 2 medium ripe avocados, 1 Siggi\u2019s plain yogurt, small bunch cilantro (about 20 stems), 2 squeezed limes (more if too spicy for your liking), 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp chipotle powder, salt to taste then blend for about 1 minute or until smooth This spread not only goes great on toast, it\u2019s also great as a dip as well!

Remove the jug from the food processor and stir through the chocolate chips. Add the brownie mixture to the tin and evenly spread out the mixture with the back of a spoon. Bake the brownies in the oven at 180 degrees C for 20-25 mins or until a skewer comes out clean. Allow the brownies to cool for around 30 mins before serving.

B) Go fancy/ more indulgent: Melt 30g vegan butter with 30g brown sugar and 4tsp (to taste) ground cinnamon and smear all over before you roll \u2728 GLAZE for BEFORE baking: 10g vegan butter melted, mixed with about 20ml of soya milk, beat thoroughly and brush all over rolls before putting in oven \u2728 ICING (optional) for final touches \ud83e\udd24 Sugar Glaze: icing powder mixed with water, start with 2 TBSP, and add a little bit of water but by bit, beat, till no lumps and glaze is smooth, slightly thick texture. Pour all over once buns have cooled down from oven! \u23f2\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83c\udf73METHOD: (Pre-heat oven to 180c) 1) Prepare dough: Warm the milk \ud83e\udd5band butter \ud83e\uddc8together till melted but not too hot or this will affect yeast. 2)Once not too hot, add the yeast and give it about 15 mins to activate. Add your sugar, and salt, and then slowly begin adding the flour bit by bit and start to knead.

If you over knead it\u2019ll become tough and more chewy once cooked so keep it light! 4) Set in a covered bowl to rise for 50 mins \u23f3or so, it should be quite a lot larger! 5) Once it\u2019s ready, flour your surface and roll it out till about 1/ 1.5cm thick. Now you can choose which filling you\u2019ll go for and spread decently all over the up facing side. Once done, start to roll into a Swiss roll style shape. 6) Cut \ud83d\udd2ainto decent slices, try to keep them the same width so they cook evenly. And place in a baking tray with parchment paper. 7) Brush with your glaze that\u2019s been made for prior to oven baking, for nice golden touch! 8) Cover and leave to rise again for 15 mins. 9) Then BAKE! 30mins should do it depending on your oven and how strong it is!

It requires patience but almost no maintenance. Follow @thefrenchiegardener to learn how to grow your own food in pots & containers, on your balcony, terrace or patio * Out of one organic ginger rhizome, you can harvest many new ones and the growing process is easy! Step by step explanations : \ud83c\udf31 Buy an organic ginger at your local market. Organic is important to make sure it is not treated with anti-growth/sprout products. Your Ginger will need to sprout. \ud83c\udf31 Keep your ginger rhizome indoor in a small plate with water. Spray water every day to keep it humid. \ud83c\udf31 After a few weeks, it will develop sprouting eyes. Stems will develop and grow from these eyes. \ud83c\udf31 Plant your rhizome in a pot of 4L / 1 Gallon, water regularly & keep indoor at warmth. Green stems will develop in a few weeks. \ud83c\udf31 After your last spring frost date, plant out outdoor in a bigger pot of minimum 20L/ 5 Gallon. You can add some mulch. Place in half sun half shade location. Water regularly. \ud83c\udf31 Without any big maintenance, after 9/10 months, your ginger will be ready for harvest. The taste of homegrown ginger has truly no comparison. Fresh & tasty! Indeed Ginger has also many health benefits. I love to have a shot of ginger/turmeric in the morning!

Here we go. recipe by @veganbarrel (Being Vegan) - see original post \ud83c\udf31 By @bakinghermann Just like the Rye Bread, the focaccia is probably one of the easiest sourdough breads to make. Similar to the rye, it is baked in a dish, meaning that you skip the more challenging stages of shaping it by hand, letting it proof in a basket and then placing it into your casserole. It also means, that you can use a higher hydration, resulting in a well risen bread with a soft inside and a thin crunchy crust. Traditionally, you\u2019d use honey, which I\u2019ve substituted with sugar. The glucose speeds up the fermentation, creating a beautifully open structured with a noticeable tangy flavour. If you\u2019d like the flavour less dominant, simply reduce the time in the fridge by a couple of hours or leave out the sugar.

Remove the tray from the oven. Add the quartered onions and garlic cloves and return to the oven for another 15 minutes. Cook the pasta in boiling salted water as per packet instructions and make sure you reserve some pasta water. Leave the roasted veggies to cool for 5 minutes. Then peel the onion and garlic, and remove any skin, stalks and seeds from the red peppers. Transfer them to a blender. Drain the cashews and add them to the blender, along with the plant-based milk, 250ml (1 cup) of pasta water you reserved earlier, dried mixed herbs, sun-dried tomatoes (drain as much oil as possible), balsamic vinegar, nutritional yeast, and very generous pinches of salt and pepper.

Serves 2 (double quantities to serve 4) For the tofu: 280g extra firm tofu, pressed for 10 minutes 1 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp cornstarch For the sauce 3 tbsp vegan ghee or butter 1 large onion, diced 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 8-10 curry leaves 1 tbsp garam masala 1 tbsp ground coriander 1 tbsp cumin seeds, toasted 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 1 tsp salt 4 tbsp tomato paste 400g full fat coconut milk Wrap the tofu with a clean tea towel or paper towel and stack something heavy like books/sauce pot to press the liquid from the tofu. Press for 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200C/392F. Tear the tofu into smaller pieces, place in a mixing bowl and mix the olive oil and cornstarch until everything is coated evenly. Place the tofu on the baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes. While the tofu bakes, make the creamy sauce. Melt the ghee then add the onions, garlic and ginger and saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes. Add the remaining spices, tomato paste and coconut milk. Stir until combined, then simmer for 10 minutes. When the tofu\u2019s finished baking, add it to the sauce and stir to coat everything. Serve with rice, toasted coconut flakes and fresh coriander.

This usually takes around 4-5 minutes for each side and is the best way to obtain that delicious smoky flavor. Leave the eggplant to cool completely, or cover with plastic wrap for 20-30 minutes and then remove the charred skin. It should come off easily. If there are a few stuck bits, use bits of tissue paper to help remove them - just don't rinse the aubergine underwater or you'll remove the smoky flavor and affect the texture. Mash the eggplant flesh in a bowl, using a fork. You can also use a blender or food processor Add salt, garlic, tahini, lemon juice, and mix well. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if necessary. Finally, top the eggplant mixture with olive oil and sprinkle with parsley and pomegranate seeds. Enjoy along with Lebanese Pita bread! To Serve & Store: This Moutabal can be served at room temperature or chilled. Keep it fresh in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-5 days.

Inspired by cold sesame noodles \u9ebb\u91ac\u6dbc\u9eb5, this is a dish I loved when I cooked in the US, where lao gan ma \u8001\u5e72\u5abd has quite the devoted following.

Choose fresh and young eggplants; these have white tops and firm, dark-purple skin with no green scars. They also have white flesh, less seeds, and taste sweet instead of bitter. I soak them for 2-3 mins in a vinegar bath (1 cup water, 2 Tbsp white vinegar, \u00bc tsp salt) to retain that vibrant purple color; they won\u2019t taste acidic, actually a little sweeter. The eggplants must be cooked at a heat above 100 C (212 F), to lock in the color. This is why most cooks pass them through oil (\u904e\u6cb9). I\u2019ve had my fair share of unappetizing, green-ish brown steamed eggplants, to finally learn that you have to steam with the skins facing down (direct contact with heat). I also recommend using a wide flat-bottomed steamer that has holes throughout, so you can lay the eggplants in a single layer.

Perhaps my most favorite salad and dressing combo so far! If you have tried and liked my other ShredHappens salad recipes, I have a feeling you\u2019ll really enjoy this one. . The spicy cashew dressing is full of flavor - the cashew, ginger, lime, and garlic, combined with the rice vinegar just go so so well together. You have the option of adding some pepper or extra chili flakes for more of a kick and that\u2019s when things really get interesting! . Here is how I made it: . 1.Lets start with our base. You can use anything you like here, but I personally prefer this combination. Shred up 1/2 small purple cabbage (finely shred is the way to go, this is ShredHappens after all, \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude02!), add into a bow, then finely dice/chop up 3 Persian cucumbers, 1 red bell pepper, 2 scallions, half a small shallot, handful of fresh cilantro, and 1 small avocado. . 2.Add those all into a bowl, then lets get the spicy cashew dressing going. . 3.In a small food process or blender, add 1/2 cup cashews, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1.5 tablespoons sesame oil, 3 tablespoons rice vinegar, 3 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari, 2.5 tablespoons nutritional yeast, 1 chunk of ginger, 2 cloves of garlic, green chili or pepper of choice (based on your spicy preference), juice of 2 limes, a small handful of cilantro, red chili flakes to taste, and a small pinch of sea salt. . 4.Give the dressing a good blend, give it a taste, then add more of what you like. You\u2019ll probably want to adjust acidity by adding more lime juice, or bring out the flavors by adding more salt, or control the spicy level by adding more cashews if you want it less spicy or more chili flakes if you want it more spicy. . 5.Top your dressing with the dressing, top with white sesame seeds, give it a good toss, then enjoy as is, with some lowcarb chips/crackers, or as a side to your main dish. .
